<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE ROMANCE OF A MONTH.
</h3>

<p>
"Adios, Señora Paulina&mdash;adios, mi Señora Dominga."
</p>

<p>
"Adios, Señor Don Ricardo," replied a sweet voice
from the depths of the old Spanish coach.
</p>

<p>
"Vaya usted con Dios, y que no haya novedad
Señoras," said I, making a vigorous effort with my
best Castilian; and with these words, and one bright
parting glance from two black Andalusian eyes, so
ended my little romance of a month, as the
old-fashioned coach, which was doubtless the production
of some cunning workman of Seville or Jaen, rolled
slowly, pompously, and heavily away towards the
Spanish lines, from the north gate of Gibraltar.
</p>

<p>
And this farewell took place exactly this day twelve
months ago.
</p>

<p>
The coach which bore away the old lady who
rejoiced in the euphonious cognomen of Donna
Dominga de Lucena y Colmenar de Orieja, and her
daughter the pretty Paulina, was a genuine old
Castilian contrivance of the true caravan species; and,
though still in use, in this our age of luxury and
invention, had been constructed, perhaps, before folding
steps were conceived; for a three-legged stool, to
facilitate ingress and egress, hung near the door.
The roof was shaped like the crust of an apple-pie,
and the lower carriage, like that portion of a
triumphal car.  It was drawn by a pair of fat sleek mules,
which seemed to have grown old with the vehicle, and
with Pedrillo, the little postilion, who floundered
away on a demi-pique saddle, with a gigantic cocked
hat surmounting his dark visage; and his lean spindle
legs lost in two gigantic jack-boots, which belonged
to the beforesaid saddle rather than to his own person.
</p>

<p>
Such was the antediluvian vehicle which bore away
the pompous old Donna and her daughter the
charming Paulina, who, for the past month (during
which she had resided in Gibraltar), had turned all
the heads of "Ours;" and was boasted by the
Spaniards as the fairest belle in las Cuatros Reinos&mdash;yes
in the three mighty little kingdoms of Seville,
Cordova, Jaen, and Granada, which are now
conglomerated into the beautiful province of Andalusia.
</p>

<p>
And so, without other escort than the redoubtable
Pedrillo, who wore a trabujo or blunderbuss slung
across his back, and strong in their belief in the
virtues of the Santa Faz of Jaen, a picture of which
was hung in the back of their coach, these two Spanish
ladies, on the conclusion of their visit, departed
on their return to Seville, their native city; and from
the British fortifications, which frown in solid tiers
towards the Spanish lines, I watched the venerable
carrozzo as it rolled across the low sandy Isthmus,
which is known as the neutral ground; and it
disappeared just as the sun began to fade upon the
beautiful masses of the Serrania de Rondo, which
rose in piles against the golden clouds, and as the
evening gun pealed like thunder among the Moorish
peaks of Jebel Tarik; and then I turned away with
a sigh as I thought of the winning smile I should
never see again.
</p>

<p>
"It's all over now, Ramble," said my friend Jack
Slingsby, who was the subaltern of my company,
and who had been my chum at Sandhurst; "it is all
over, Dick," he continued, with a laugh and one of
those rough slaps on the shoulder, which no one
ventures to give but an Englishman; "and so, instead
of airing your sorrows here, 'sighing to the evening
breeze' and all that sort of thing, you may as well
come with me and knock the balls about a little&mdash;or
join Shafton, the colonel, and some of "Ours" who
have proposed a pool to-night&mdash;and meanwhile solace
yourself with another of my 'very superior' cabanas."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is as well she is gone, Jack," said I,
endeavouring to imitate his light-hearted indifference;
"had she remained among us another week, I would
certainly have booked for her, and so have bedevilled
myself, as you said yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"For Donna Paulina?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;had you any doubts as to which?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;no.  I certainly did not think that you
were in love with the mother."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said I, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Paulina is very beautiful, no doubt; she has those
Andalusian eyes and ancles which all the world talk
about, but which all the world must see to feel the
full effect of either.  She has a charming manner&mdash;a
glorious 'espiêglerie'&mdash;yes, that's the word! full of
pretty repartee, and all that sort of thing&mdash;you
understand me, Dick, or Don Ricardo, as she called you;
but withal, I assure you, I should not like to enter
for a Spanish wife, of all women in the world; no,
no&mdash;what does the song say?" and as we reascended
to the higher parts of the fortress, this careless fellow
sang aloud a scrap of a popular mess-table song,
somewhat to this purpose:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "No fair fräulein or demoiselle, nor donna with her smile,<br />
  Shall ever teach me to forget the dear ones of our isle;<br />
  And when I seek a heart and hand among the fair and free,<br />
  Still constant in my faith, I'll say an English girl for me."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"That is the mark, Dick,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "&mdash;&mdash;an English girl for me!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Besides, half of the young fellows in garrison here
ran after Paulina; and at every mess-table she was as
well known as the big drum, or the regimental
snuff-box, or that great ram's head with its devilish horns,
with which those highland fellows of the 92nd
decorate their table, after the cloth is removed.  At every
jail, field-day, and tertulia&mdash;at church, and on the
promenade, a crowd of admirers surrounded her, like
flies round honey, and she seemed to be equally
delighted with all."
</p>

<p>
"That was one of the peculiar charms of her
manner, Jack," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Peculiar, indeed!" said he, letting out a cloud of
smoke from his well-mustachioed lip.
</p>

<p>
"In public, she distinguished none in particular,
but was alike gay with all."
</p>

<p>
"And in private, who was said generally to be the
happy Lothario?"
</p>

<p>
I made no reply, but knocked the ashes away from
the 'very superior' cabana, with which he had just
favoured me.
</p>

<p>
"It was said to be a certain person known as Dick
Ramble of 'Ours'," continued Slingsby, in his
bantering way; "but I am deuced glad it is all over, like
any other flirtation, and you are 'free to win and free
to wed another;' I don't like Spaniards&mdash;and never
shall.  In fact, I have hated them ever since that
unpleasant adventure I had at Malaga last year, and
about which I shall tell you some other time; but
here come Shafton, Morton, and some more of 'Ours,'
and as soon as we leave the mess, we shall adjourn to
the billiard table."
</p>

<p>
What this 'unpleasant adventure,' to which Slingsby
referred&mdash;and to which I had often heard him
refer before&mdash;might have been I cared not then to
inquire; but walked on, more chilled than consoled by
his rattling manner and by that mess-room raillery,
which I have known to laugh many a wiser man than
your humble servant, out of an honest and sincere
passion; while it has also been the saving of many
an inflammable "Newcome," or unfledged, but
amatory ensign, from the lures of those passé garrison
belles, whose feathers are beginning to moult, and
whose brilliance is beginning to fade, after a long
career of close flirtation, round-dancing, supper-crushes,
cold fowl, ices, pink champagne, affectionate
farewells in the grey morning, when the drowsy
drum-boys beat reveillie, or when the route arrived,
and each lover&mdash;a lover alas! but for the time&mdash;departed
with his regiment to return no more.
</p>

<p>
Of Paulina de Lucena (such a pretty name it is!)
I had seen much during her short residence in
Gibraltar, and had become&mdash;what shall I term it, for
'Ours' were not marrying men&mdash;charmed by her
sweetness of temper and piquant manner, as well as
by her acknowledged beauty.
</p>

<p>
Jack Slingsby stigmatised this under the denomination
of "being spooney;" but as I have a proper
abhorrence of all that slang phraseology which is
peculiar to the university, the barrack, the clubhouse,
and the turf, I believe I shall quote honest Jack no
more, but proceed in my own fashion.
</p>

<p>
She was the only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel
Don Ignacio de Lucena, a Knight of San Ferdinando,
an officer of Lancers in the service of the Queen of
Spain, in one of whose battles he was taken prisoner
by Cabrera, and shot in cold blood with fifty of his
soldiers: for this ferocious Carlist behaved with such
barbarity to the Constitutional Army that one of its
officers, who had been a prisoner, assured me that
at Valencia he and his comrades were subjected to
such cruelty by their captors, that after a thousand
sufferings, on being denied food, they were driven to
the dreadful necessity of devouring the body of a
fellow captive.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A work published in Valencia positively asserts this.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The profession of her father, together with the
circumstance of one of her brothers being in the
Spanish sea service, and another in the army of
Portugal, caused her to view with a favourable eye all
who have the honour to live by the sword; and my
small smattering of Spanish, which I picked up in
those idle hours of a garrison life that otherwise
must have hung heavily over me, gave me every
facility for cultivating a friendship which had in it
everything that might serve to dazzle and charm a young
man; for with the idea of Andalusia and Spanish
beauty we are apt to conjure up so much of love
and of romance that the imagination gets the better
of the senses; besides, those rogues of travellers and
romancers have always given us such exaggerated
pictures of Spanish loveliness.
</p>

<p>
In regularity of feature and fairness of complexion,
Donna Paulina was inferior to many a pretty girl I
have seen at home.  Her most glorious attractions
were her dark glossy tresses and her black eloquent
eyes&mdash;brilliant, sad, subduing, ever varying, but ever
black, and under their long, long fringes, ever
melting.  In beauty of form and grace of movement
she was unmatched out of her own province, and I
can assure the reader that the first time her very
striking figure appeared among the promenaders in
the Alameda of Gibraltar with her drapery of black
lace falling from a high pearl comb, her mantilla,
her close-fitting dress, her pretty feet in their
Cordovan slippers, and her large fan, the unhappy bones
of which were ever in a state of flutter and excitement,
and between which she shot her most dangerous
glances, it occasioned much marvel, curiosity, and
speculation at all the mess-tables of Her Majesty's
forces stationed on the rock.
</p>

<p>
To such a companion imagine the charm of acting
cicerone about the fortifications of old Gibraltar;
imagine our evening rambles round Rosia Bay and
along the new mole, where the ships of the British
and Yankees, the French, Spaniards, Portuguese,
Italians, Turks, Greeks, Moors, Arabs, and Jews,
with all their varieties of ensigns, costume and rig,
are riding at anchor, and where many a grim mortar
and cannon gun frown over the new bastion; imagine
the transition from the sunny Alameda to the deep
cool galleries which are hewn in the heart of the
living rock, and which are now turned to such
war-like purposes as old Pomponius Mela, who first wrote
of them, could never have conceived, and where we
wandered for many an hour, the pretty donna forgetting
the starched customs of her country so far as
to grasp my arm with both her hands at times, for the
aspect of these places filled her with timidity and
awe.
</p>

<p>
To these subterranean batteries there is admitted
but a dim and dubious light that steals through their
embrasures, glinting on the damp slime of their
walls and roof of rock; and on the heavy
ordnance&mdash;sixty-eight pounders some of them&mdash;which stand
on frames of metal, on piles of balls and bombs, and
on doors studded with iron, that lead to other and inner
vaults full of missiles and unknown terrors.
</p>

<p>
On, on would we wander, through grim batteries,
gloomy magazines, and far-stretching galleries, that
seemed to be without end, obtaining at times through
the vaulted embrasures a glimpse of the town, then
basking in the glare of the noonday sun, or of the
sea, shining under a brilliance in which the vessels
on its bosom became lost, while we heard only the
sound of our own voices, the twang of a bugle, or
the sharp rat-tat of a drum in the barracks, the faint
boom of a breaker on the cliffs, or the fainter sound
of voices in the town, far, far down below, where all
the races of the world were mingling; for there, in
its streets, might be seen the smart Greek in his
scarlet fez and ample kilt; the hideous Afric Jew in his
black and white striped cowl; the slow and solemn
Turk; the bare-kneed Scottish soldier; the lively
Italian sailor, and the puffing, perspiring, and
grumbling John Bull.
</p>

<p>
I saw Paulina daily, and garrison life became one
long and enchanting dream!
</p>

<p>
In the batteries of the rock we promenaded often
when the heat became too great in the sunny
Alameda, and with such a companion, while wandering
through the subterranean and twilight shades of
Saint George's Hall, or the Windsor Gallery, how was
it possible to escape from loving her.&mdash;A coquettish
Andalusian, who, whenever I ventured to become a
little more tender than usual, would tap me over the
fingers with her fan, or give me one brilliant, flashing
and fascinating glance, as she closed her screen of
black lace, and threatened to leave me, while she
sang, with the most charming grace in the world,
"Pues por besarte Minguillo," the English of which
is somewhat to the following purpose:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Give me swiftly back, thou dear one,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the kiss I gave to you;<br />
  Give me back the kiss, for mother<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is impatient&mdash;prithee do!<br />
  Give me that, and take another,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that one, thou shalt have two."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And where, the while, the reader may naturally
enquire, was the cautious, suspicious, and lynx-eyed
Spanish mother therein referred to?
</p>

<p>
Now old Donna Dominga had conceived a vehement
friendship for me since the first evening on
which I had the pleasure of meeting her at the
residence of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief;
and where I supplied her with ices when she was
warm, adjusted her mantilla when she was cool, held
her fan, snuff-box, and poodle, and brought her a
cigarillo and orange-water dashed with the smallest
taste of brandy; and, discovering her sympathies and
antipathies, soon learned to anathematise Cabrera
and the Conde de Montmolin, to express a vague
belief in miracles in general, and the verity of the
Holy Face of Jaen in particular.  I "turned" the
old lady's flank, and established myself safely under
the wing of her prejudices.
</p>

<p>
She always accompanied Paulina and me in our
rambles; but I generally contrived, by a little
successful manoeuvring, to leave her to the care of
Dr. MacLeechy, our senior surgeon, after Jack Slingsby
had very disobligingly revolted against this duty;
and as the doctor and the Donna were either
somewhat pursy, or disposed to prose and linger, we
usually left them far in the rear and lost sight of them
altogether.
</p>

<p>
Now the doctor, who quoted Kelaart as if he had
been his own father, and expatiated to the old lady
on geology (with mineralogy, botany, and Scottish
metaphysics), was so very particular in explaining the
leaves, fibres, and various properties of the <i>Iberus
Giberaltarica</i>, the only plant peculiar to the rock,
that the stout Donna Dominga, who deemed all this
but the language of the flowers, and viewed
everything through the medium of gallantry, became
troubled in spirit, and would occasionally blush behind
the sticks of her fan, or ogle and look unutterable
things at our poor unconscious medico.  She would
sigh tenderly when he plucked the soft palmetto
which grows in the rocky crevices, or tremble over
the white polyanthus, and was ready to drop like a
ripe pumpkin into his arms, when he grew eloquent
upon the various species of the cacti.
</p>

<p>
This was all very well while it lasted, for while the
ponderous old donna thought that our quiet, canny,
and discreet Galen, who signed himself M.D. of
St. Andrews, and F.E.C.S. of Edinburgh, was a lover of
her own, she forgot to look too narrowly after us;
and believed that she had found a most agreeable
mode of passing the month in Gibraltar, which, for
change of air, had been recommended by some
sangrado of Seville, as her health had become
somewhat impaired by ease and good living.
</p>

<p>
I was so dazzled and delighted with the charming
Paulina, and her pretty little ways, that I had really
begun to prepare my mind for repelling the banter
of the mess, and for waiting with due solemnity
upon Donna Dominga to confer with her alone,
upon settlements and so forth, when a terrible
denouement took place!  Having rashly boasted of
her imaginary conquest over our doctor, to a lady
whom she met at the house of a rich Spanish
merchant in the Alameda, there ensued between them
an immediate scene; for this unlucky communication
(given with all the coy triumph with which
the plump old lady could invest it) was made to no
other than the doctor's wife, who had just arrived
from Dublin; and as it had never entered the head
of Donna Dominga to inquire whether our
unsuspecting medico was a Benedick&mdash;bond or free, as
they say in Australia&mdash;a storm was the consequence.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mrs. Leechy MacLeechy, our Scotch doctor's
better half, was a strong-minded Irish woman, who
wore a species of turban, and was the terror of the
regiment; on each of her fat wrists she wore a
bracelet of blood-encrusted medals, torn, as she said,
"off Rooshian breasts," and sent to her from
Sebastopol by her brother, who was "the matchor&mdash;the
saynior matchor&mdash;devil a less, or the foighting
eighty-ayth;" and so this lady, in her deep Galway
patois, poured on the Spaniard a broadside that
would have sunk the Santissima Trinidad.
</p>

<p>
Finding her love affair at an end, the cruel donna
resolved to cut short mine.  Within an hour after
this meeting, Pedrillo was summoned; the old
Spanish coach was brought forth; the baggage packed,
and her farewell cards&mdash;P.P.C.&mdash;dispatched to the
governor and his military secretary; to the aides-de-camp
and staff colonel; to the officers commanding
regiments, and all the great folks of the place.  The
old lady and the pretty Paulina got into the depths
of the ponderous 'carrozza;' the three-legged stool
was strapped to the door; Pedrillo clambered into
his bucket-like boots, and muttered many 'carajos!'
as he applied his latigo to the sleek sides of the
dapple mules, and while their proprietrix was sulking
and fuming at Gibraltar and all the heretics who
dwelt therein, the huge conveyance crawled along
the narrow causeway which forms the communication
between the town and the isthmus, and, for the
present, thus ended, as I have said, my pleasant
little Spanish romance of a month.
</p>

<p>
A recollection was all that remained to me of
Paulina, and of that flirtation which was fast
maturing into something of a better and more lasting
nature.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE GUARDA COSTA.
</h3>

<p>
During the two preceding months we had been
daily expecting orders to embark for the Crimea,
and this expectation formed almost our sole topic at
mess; but days became weeks, and weeks became
months, yet we heard no more of it than what passed
among ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Transports laden with troops&mdash;horse, foot, and
artillery&mdash;touched daily at the Rock, and steamed
on into the bright blue Mediterranean, with
spirit-stirring cheers rising from their crowded decks.
Regiments junior to ours were withdrawn from the
Rock and dispatched to that scene of bravery and
bloodshed, of mismanagement and disaster, towards
which all our thoughts, our hopes, and hearts were
turned; but the route never came for "Ours," and
we grew decidedly peevish, and found the dull
routine of duty among the endless batteries, bastions,
curtains, magazines, and casemates of that mighty
fortress which was so long boasted (before the days
of steam) as the key of "the great French lake,"
sufficiently tedious; for we felt that we were merely
playing at soldiers like militiamen, while our
comrades of the line were engaged in desperate work,
and played the great game of war, with the eyes of
all the world upon them.
</p>

<p>
One evening, about a week after the departure
of the ladies, I was captain of the guard at the New
Mole Fort, and Jack Slingsby was my subaltern.
We had just finished the dinner which had been
sent to us, hot and smoking, from the mess-house,
in a conveyance for the purpose; the windows of
the officers' guardroom were open, and with a box of
contraband cigars, a few periodicals from the
garrison library, a telescope to watch the passing ships,
and a bottle or two of very choice mess claret, we
were dozing the sunny evening of Andalusia very
comfortably away.
</p>

<p>
The last dispatches from the Crimea had been
read and discussed by us; the last lists of killed,
wounded, frozen, or missing in the trenches had
been conned over for some familiar name, which
brought vividly before us some fine fellow we should
never see again; but whose sudden fate was the
more interesting to us, because it soon might be
our own.
</p>

<p>
Whether it was the result of the good dinner, the
good wine, the sultry atmosphere, or our own thoughts
that oppressed us, I know not; but we sat long
silent, and gazing at the varied scenery and
glittering waters of the bay.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts were still wandering after Paulina,
and I was endeavouring to imagine what she might
be about at that precise moment.
</p>

<p>
Slingsby had lost a very heavy and very absurd
bet, on an interesting race run at Grand Cairo
between an Irish mare and an Arab horse belonging
to Halim Pasha, when the former beat the latter "all
to nothing," as Jack phrased it, and he had to hand
over 500<i>l.</i> to Morton, our colonel, for booking on
a horse which neither of them had ever seen.
The same race was offered for the last two years
against all England, for ten thousand sovereigns,
and, as all the sporting world know, the challenge
was not accepted.  Blue-devilled by his loss, Jack
Slingsby sipped his claret in silence and made wise
resolutions which he never intended to keep, with
moral reflections which he never could practise, and
longed for the Crimea, insensible to the charms of
this delightful climate, where, even in January, the
narcissus-polyanthus hang in white clusters from the
rocks; where the purple lavender flowers in large
beds and parterres; where the palmetto spreads its
fan-like foliage to the sun; where the gigantic aloe
puts forth its leaves, and the prickly pear expands
its ponderous bunches, while the wild tulip and the
damascus-tree are in full blossom under the gloom
of the solemn pine, or the lighter foliage of the
cork-tree&mdash;and where all is verdure, fragrance, and joy!
Yet, amid all this, Jack Slingsby, like the rest of
"Ours," sighed for the frozen camp, the battered
trenches, and the misery of Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
"So you have not got the better of your Spanish
fancies, eh?" said he, for lack of something
better to talk about; "the charming Paulina&mdash;that
most rotund of elderly females, her mamma, and all
that sort of thing?"
</p>

<p>
"What leads you to think so?" I asked languidly,
as I lay stretched at length on the Windsor chairs,
watching the smoke which ascended from my lips to
the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"It is quite plain, dear Don Ricardo."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot mimic her, so don't attempt it, Jack;
but how is it plain, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"As clear as when the right is in front, the left is
the pivot."
</p>

<p>
"A technical reply."
</p>

<p>
"Dick Ramble, my boy, you are quite sad about
her, and there is no use in attempting to conceal it,"
continued Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"Not sad, exactly," said I, making an effort to
look brave; "never was I fool enough to be sad
about any woman yet; there are as good fish, &amp;c.,
and as for the Spanish girl&mdash;try another Cuba, the
box is beside you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks&mdash;about this Spanish girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Fill your glass, and push across the decanter;
has not that bottle been a little corked, think
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps&mdash;about this Spanish girl?" continued
Jack doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what the deuce about her?"
</p>

<p>
"You were just on the point of remarking some
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Only that her eyes were very fine, were they not?"
</p>

<p>
"Very, but I prefer blue&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'No fair fräulein nor dem&mdash;&mdash;-'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"For heaven's sake, Jack, don't begin that
ever-lasting ditty!" said I, pettishly; "yes, Paulina's
eyes were beautiful; they seemed, as the Spaniards
say, to be in mourning for the murders they committed."
</p>

<p>
"A stale compliment," was Jack's retort to my
interruption of a song with which he had favoured
the mess every night since we left Southampton, for
a small amount of vocal talent will go a long way
to charm a mess-table; "she murdered you,
however, with very little compunction; but to think of
the doctor's botanising with the mother being
mistaken for love-making&mdash;was it not glorious, Dick?"
</p>

<p>
"I have sometimes thought of a month's leave,
just between musters," said I, without joining in
Jack's boisterous laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Leave! for what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"A ride into Spain&mdash;say, as far as Seville; what
do you think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Seventy miles or more to help you to continue
a flirtation begun in the casemates of Gibraltar.
Thank you, Ramble; I would rather hold myself
excused.  I had a little adventure in Spain once
before, and its devilish concomitants quite cured me
of all taste for another; though if I had not lost this
unlucky 500<i>l.</i> perhaps&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, why the deuce did you not let Halim
Pasha and his nag alone?  What did their race
matter to you?"
</p>

<p>
"But lend me the telescope&mdash;what is that puff&mdash;a
gun?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a smuggler running right for the harbour,
pursued by a Spanish guarda costa; bang! there
goes another gun from the Don."
</p>

<p>
"And right through the felucca's sail too!"
</p>

<p>
"Hollo! they will be within gunshot of us ere
long," said I, springing up: "and this will be work
for us.  Sentry, call the gunner of the guard."
</p>

<p>
"Gunner of the guard!" reiterated the sentinel,
who stood, bayonet in hand, under a sunshade, at
the guard-house door.
</p>

<p>
The solitary artilleryman, who was attached to my
guard, appeared in an instant with his sword by his
side, and a lintstock in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Get ready a gun," said I; "for there is a Spanish
guarda costa in pursuit of a smuggler, and we must
protect our friend."
</p>

<p>
"An 18-pounder, or a 24, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, give him a twenty-four, and take a file of
the guard to assist you."
</p>

<p>
While the smuggler, with her long sweeps out,
and every stitch of canvas crowded on her long and
tapering masts and whip-like yards, was straining
every nerve to escape from the Spanish cruiser,
which plied away with her bow guns, and bore after
her close-hauled, and rushing through the shining
waves till they seemed to smoke under her, it may
be necessary to inform the reader that the
manufacture and smuggling of tobacco and cigars at
Gibraltar is a never-failing and never-ending source
of angry discussion between the Governments of
Spain and Britain; for, by the former, tobacco has
long been reckoned a royal monopoly.  Now, in
Gibraltar, almost every second house is a cigar-shop,
and more than two thousand men are daily employed
in the manufacture of these articles of luxury,
without which a Spaniard would be, as some one says.
like a steamer without a funnel.  Three-fourths of
the British exports from Gibraltar to the three United
Kingdoms are also smuggled, and to such an extent
is the contraband trade carried, that the annual
importation of tobacco into that fortified town, says
Mr Porter, in his "Progress of the Nation," "amounts
to from six millions to eight millions of pounds,
nearly the whole of which is purchased by smugglers."
</p>

<p>
The boats of the contrabandistas are generally
rigged as feluccas, and painted black; they are built
sharp as a pike-head, and carry a heavy brass gun,
which, in harbour, is usually concealed under a pile
of old boxes and casks, with a tarpaulin thrown over
it, while in cases of emergency, various pistols, pikes,
and cutlasses, make their appearance in the hands of
the brown-visaged, black-bearded, red-sashed, and
rather pictorial-looking ruffians, whose chief
occupation is to sleep and lounge about their decks by
day.
</p>

<p>
To look out for these lads of the knife and pistol,
the Government of Her Most Catholic Majesty maintains
a number of fast-sailing revenue craft, called
guarda costas, commanded by brave and vigilant
officers.  These are the abhorrence of the contrabandistas,
whose operations are greatly facilitated on
land by the concurrence of the corrupt Spanish officials;
and those guarda costas, in their zeal, had, of
late, been rash enough to pursue their prey into those
waters which are under the jurisdiction of the
Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar; and
in three instances had boarded them with pistol and
cutlass, shot the crews, or driven them overboard,
and thereafter cut the feluccas out from under the
very guns of Her Britannic Majesty's fortress.
</p>

<p>
This, however, was not to be tolerated again, and
strict orders had been issued that every guarda costa
who ventured into troubled waters should be fired
on.  John Bull is consistently absurd and unjust in
all things, and, with all his boasted justice, is the
most veritable bully in the world&mdash;except, perhaps,
his thriving son Jonathan; he would no doubt cut
his own smugglers out of any port in the world, and
in the same moment would deny the poor Spaniards
the right to do the same; for John is a man full of
honour and liberality, or a man of neither, just as
may suit his own particular purpose for the time;
but to return,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
On came the felucca in question, running straight
for the anchorage, which was protected by the heavy
guns of the New Mole Fort where we were on guard.
and the parapet of which was lined by the soldiers,
all eager to witness the result of that most exciting
of all things, a chase&mdash;a struggle between a strong
party and a weak one.  On came the guarda costa
in pursuit, plying her bow-chaser, cleaving asunder
the clouds of white smoke which ever and anon it
rolled ahead of her, and riding over the waves, then
shining in all the rosy brilliance of a Spanish
sunset, while astern waved the large ensign with the
red and yellow horizontal bars of Castile and Leon.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the little felucca ran up British colours;
a sharp patter rang over the water, and a wreath of
smoke rose from her stern as the devil-may-care
contrabandistas gave the cruiser a dose of small
arms.
</p>

<p>
Boom again!  The don gave another shot from
his brass gun, and this time an angry shout arose
from our own vessels in the roadstead, for the ball
had crossed the forefoot of a Newcastle collier.
</p>

<p>
"Ramble, this will never do," said Slingsby; "that
Spanish craft is too near by half&mdash;much nearer than
our standing orders permit."
</p>

<p>
"Now, gunner, is that 24-pounder ready?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"All ready, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then bang at her."
</p>

<p>
We all watched the shot with breathless interest,
for to us, the whole affair was merely a race, a game
of hazard, like any other.  The sullen roar of the
24-pounder shook the solid parapet of the New Mole
Fort, and pealed in repeated echoes round all the
shore to the extremity of Rosia Bay; and as the
cloud of light smoke curled away from before us, we
saw the shot whipping the water far astern of the
guarda costa, and a flush of annoyance spread over
the honest face of the artilleryman; for, as all our
eyes were bent upon his performance, he had been
most anxious to excel, and this very anxiety had
probably defeated its object.
</p>

<p>
A muttered exclamation of impatience escaped him.
</p>

<p>
"Run back the gun," said he to the guard.
</p>

<p>
Back went the carronade, and home went the
sponge, as he set his teeth, and, with hasty
determination, proceeded to reload.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, quick," said I; "for if she hauls her wind,
gunner, there will barely be time to give another
shot."
</p>

<p>
"I'll toss you for it, Señor Capitano," said Slingsby;
"bet you a bottle of champagne that I will hit
the guarda costa."
</p>

<p>
"Done," said I; "toss for the first fire."
</p>

<p>
We tossed, and it fell to Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Take care that you don't hit the felucca."
</p>

<p>
"Miss the pigeon and hit the crow&mdash;eh, Dick?" he
said, while, laughing, he applied his eye to the sites
on the breech, and proceeded to adjust the screw, to
the evident annoyance of the gunner, who, while he
could not decline to relinquish his place to an officer,
was piqued on being deprived of a chance of retrieving
his name as a professional marksman; and now he
stood by, with his match lighted, in the earnest hope,
doubtless, that Jack Slingsby would send his shot as
wide of the mark as possible.  Cigar in mouth, Jack
glanced coolly&mdash;almost carelessly&mdash;along the gun,
and on covering his object, cried&mdash;"fire!"
</p>

<p>
Again the lintstock fell on the touch-hole; again
the gun-shot rolled along the echoing shore, and
pealed away to seaward; a large white splinter was
seen on the gunwale of the guarda costa; her sails
shivered and flapped in the wind, as the ball struck
her, and suddenly backing her mainyard, she lay to,
heaving like a wounded seabird, on the long glassy
ridges of the ground-swell, ere the burst of applause
with which our soldiers greeted Slingsby had died
away&mdash;for my friend Jack was one of their most
favourite officers.
</p>

<p>
"You did for her, there, sir," said the gunner,
approvingly, as he rammed home the sponge.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but as you fired when she was much further
off, remember that I have the less credit in hitting,"
replied Jack, as he gave the gunner a crown-piece to
console him.
</p>

<p>
By this time the felucca, with a shout of derision
rising from her deck, ran into the harbour, ducking
her colours thrice to us in salute, as she passed the
New Mole Fort.
</p>

<p>
I had not been looking for more than a minute
through the spy-glass at the guarda costa, when I
became assured that some one on board had been
wounded severely, either by the shot or its splinters.
The crew&mdash;all save the man at the wheel&mdash;were
grouped amidships; many were kneeling on the
deck, and, once or twice, clenched hands were fiercely
shaken in menace towards the battery; then we saw
a man borne carefully aft between several others.
</p>

<p>
"Some one has evidently been killed or wounded
desperately," said I, handing the glass to Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heaven! do you say so?" cried Jack; "well,
it would seem so&mdash;poor fellow&mdash;you know, Ramble, I
did not exactly anticipate such a thing&mdash;so it is&mdash;so
it is!  There is a man stretched on the deck!" he
added, passing the telescope to our soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"We have only obeyed a standing garrison order,"
said I; "and the responsibility thereof, if any, does
not lie with us, but with those who issued it.  Come
back to the guard-room, Jack, and my servant shall
go to the messman for that bottle of champagne you
have won so well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! deuce take the champagne, and all that sort
of thing," said Jack, looking still at the guarda costa.
</p>

<p>
For a time an evident confusion and indecision,
seemed to reign among her crew.  She lay heaving
and tossing, rising and falling on the long and ridgy
rollers, with the setting sun glaring full upon her
white mainsail, which lay flat to the mast; the light
of day soon sank in the west, behind the upper peak
of the rocky mountain, from which a myriad rays
shot upward and played on the masses of floating
cloud; the strait was still bathed in the amber glory
of evening, and each glassy billow of the slow ground-swell
as it rolled away from west to east, rose like
a bank of gold from a plain of brilliant blue; and all
the amphitheatre of the town, which stretches along
the base of the rock, and rises gradually from the
shore in the most delightful manner&mdash;mingling in
picturesque confusion, the lofty and airy Spanish
caza, with its flat roof, verandah, and sun-shaded
windows, the close, compact English house, the solid
rampart, and the flimsy wooden storehouse&mdash;all were
bathed in the warmest tints, and every casement and
window flung back the gleams of radiance, as if they
had been illuminated by lamps of crimson and gold.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the departed sun had shed its last ray
on the bare scalp of the sugar-loaf, the crew of the
guarda costa, as a protection probably, hoisted British
colours, and crept past us into the harbour, and
immediately on dropping her anchor, sent a boat ashore.
</p>

<p>
We supposed that this visit could only be for the
purpose of lodging a complaint against the officer in
command at the New Mole Fort&mdash;to wit myself, a
complaint which we knew would be unavailing: but
we were mistaken; for my servant, on returning from
the barracks with the bottle of champagne and other
&amp;c. requisite to enable Jack and me to pass the night
on guard agreeably, brought us the unpleasant
information that the shot had carried away both legs of
the unfortunate Spanish lieutenant who commanded
the guarda costa, and that doctor M'Leechy of "Ours"
had at once gone off to the vessel to succour the
patient, who&mdash;poor fellow!&mdash;had died under his
hands.
</p>

<p>
This catastrophe proved a great damper to us, and
to Jack in particular, for he was one of the
best-hearted fellows in the service; so we had more
champagne brought from the mess-house, and we talked of
the guarda costa and her poor lieutenant almost till
the morning gun was fired; and the affair furnished
me with a special paragraph for that "column of
remarks" in the guard report which seldom contains
memoranda of greater importance than a notice of
"the cracked pane of glass, handed over by Captain
O'Brien of the 88th;" or, "the poker, handed over,
broken, by the last guard under Lieutenant Smith,
of the Buffs," and so forth.
</p>

<p>
In the morning we found that the guarda costa had
sailed in the night, taking her dead commander with
her; and long before the end of the week we had
ceased even to speak of the circumstance at mess,
and I forgot the affair as the image of Paulina came
before me again, and thoughtless Jack Slingsby was
as gay as ever.
</p>

<p>
But I must mention, that on being relieved from
guard at the New Mole Fort, I found waiting me, at
my quarters, Pedro de Urquija, a well-known
contrabandista, and king of the smugglers of Gibraltar,
who gave me a profusion of thanks "for saving his
little felucca, La Buena Fortuna, from that devil of
a guarda costa," saying it was the closest run he had
ever experienced in twenty years of arduous smuggling;
and he insisted upon my acceptance of several
boxes of prime Cubas and some dozen yards of
magnificent lace, worked by the nuns of Cadiz and the
poor sisters of Santa Theresa at Estrelo, and we
parted the best friends in the world: but a heavy rod
was in pickle for Jack and me; and the affair was
destined to cost us more danger, trouble, and anxiety,
than we could ever have calculated on risking.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
JACK SLINGSBY.
</h3>

<p>
The killing of the Spanish lieutenant revived among
our diplomatic people the ever-rankling quarrel about
the contrabandistas, and the captain-general of
Andalusia wrote an angry letter to the governor of
Gibraltar, remonstrating with him on the conduct of
the officer in charge of the battery at the Mole Fort,
in daring to fire upon a Spanish government cruiser,
and requesting that the said Don Ricardo Ramble
should be given up to the Spanish authorities to be
sent to the galleys at Barcelona probably, or to be
otherwise disposed of.
</p>

<p>
This absurd demand, however, the old general
commanding waived politely; but the correspondence
was prolonged until the military secretary became
bored to death on the subject, and lost all patience
at the very mention of it.  Now as the Queen of
Spain designates herself sovereign lady of Gibraltar,
and as the alcalde of San Roque, a little town which
has sprung up within the last hundred and fifty
years, still styles himself in all official documents
Alcalde of San Roque and of Gibraltar, and holder of
supreme authority therein, the tone assumed by the
capitan-general, who was on a visit to Jaen, was
pompous, high, and mighty; for no explanation we could
give in writing could make the irritable old Castilian
hidalgo see that the lieutenant of the guarda costa
had been in the wrong.
</p>

<p>
One evening, on entering the mess-room, I was
startled by Colonel Morton acquainting me that by
directions just arrived from the Foreign Secretary he
had been requested to send the two officers who were
on guard in the new Mole Fort into Spain.
</p>

<p>
"Without hostage or guarantee&mdash;the devil!" said
I, shrugging my shoulders; "and to whom?"
</p>

<p>
"To this obstinate old bore by habit, and boar by
nature, the captain-general."
</p>

<p>
"As prisoners, colonel?" cried Slingsby, with an
astounded air from the other end of the table, and
pausing with his hand on a wine decanter; "you
don't mean to say as prisoners?"
</p>

<p>
"Prisoners&mdash;not at all; how could you think of
such a thing?" said the colonel, laughing, for he was
a hearty old soldier, at whose name stood P.W. and
K.H., and C.B. in <i>Hart's Army List</i>; "you go
merely to explain the late affair in person; and it is
the more necessary for you both to go as the two
aides-de-camp of the governor are on the sick list.  It
is only a ride of some seventy or eighty miles into
Spain&mdash;wish 't were I who had the duty to do."
</p>

<p>
"And where does the captain-general live?"
</p>

<p>
"At Seville, to which place he is now returning
from Jaen."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, indeed, Seville," said I, reviving, as I filled
my glass with Moselle, and Slingsby stuck his glass
in his remarkably knowing eye.
</p>

<p>
"You'll take good horses; but be careful of
rogues, raterillos, and footpads by the way.  I can
lend you a pair of pistols with spring bayonets."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, colonel, I have my revolver," said I,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"What! you smile, Ramble?" said the colonel;
"and believe me to have the bandittiphobia; but I
know Spain well, having marched over every foot of
the Peninsula under Lord Lyndedoch, and fought my
way from the Black Horse Square at Lisbon to the
banks of the Nive, so I know pretty well, that in
peace as in war armed desperadoes, whose hands are
against all men, are, as a certain traveller says,
'the very weeds of the Spanish soil.'  Right well do
I know the land of Los Espagnols as we used to call
them in the old fighting 5th Hussars.  I was in the
cavalry then, and had I not grown stiff in the joints,
and lost all relish for adventures by day, fleas by
night, and the resinous taste of vino out of a skin at
all times, I would have saved you the trouble of the
journey and gone myself; but my instructions from
home say that Captain Ramble and Lieutenant
Slingsby must go, so there is the end of it.  Major,
Mr. Vice, another bottle of wine to drink 'bon
voyage' to Ramble and Slingsby."
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart; sergeant Slopper, a fresh
allowance of wine," said the major.
</p>

<p>
"Wish I were going with you," said Shafton, the
captain of our light company; "a ride to Seville!
the very name of the place conjures up a sunny
vision of orange trees and glowing grapes, of black
mantillas and taper ancles, and different duty from
trenching in the Crimea as we might have been, and
ought to have been by this time."
</p>

<p>
"Aye," quoth M'Leechy the doctor, who although
married (as he knew to his cost) was dining that day
with the mess; "and a pleasant change after our
dull routine of garrison life, during which we have,
as 'Punch' says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Contentedly eat ration beefs and muttons,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contentedly drank ration rums and waters;<br />
  Darned our own socks, and sewed our own buttons,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried in summer, and froze in winter quarters."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"A fine upon the doctor," said Shafton; "colonel,
Mr. Vice, gentlemen, he vilely satirises Her Majesty's
service, a bottle of champagne from the doctor."
</p>

<p>
"You will remember us all most affectionately
to Donna Dominga and to the bewitching Paulina&mdash;you
will see them of course," said some one from the
foot of the table.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor must prepare some of the rarest
specimens of those remarkable cacti with which he
subdued the heart of the plump widow," said Slingsby,
taking up the chorus of banter, "and have them
ready by to-morrow; we start to-morrow, I presume,
colonel."
</p>

<p>
"As early as you please," said Morton.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have some glorious fun in Seville&mdash;eh,
Ramble?  You'll envy us, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"If the captain-general does not garotte you,"
snarled the doctor; "or treat you as Don Ramon
Cabrera, the Conde de Morella, treated the husband
of Donna Dominga."
</p>

<p>
"But for that gentle sigh, doctor, I would have
considered you quite a bear," said Slingsby, "but
pass the wine, M'Leechy."
</p>

<p>
"If you find Seville dull," retorted the doctor,
"you had better play the same little prank you
played at Kilkenny when you were in the Sixth."
</p>

<p>
"What did he do when in the Sixth?" inquired a
dozen voices at once.
</p>

<p>
"What did he not do you should ask," continued
the doctor, while Jack smiled faintly and filled up his
glass.  "Once when we marched into Kilkenny we
found there had been a quarrel between the Rapparees
of the district and the first battalion of Scots
Royals.  It was in the time of high Repeal
enthusiasm, and nothing was thought of but an Irish
Republic, so the people looked darkly at the
redcoats.  Now Slingsby had never been in Ireland
before, and as he received over the barrack-guard
from one of the Royals, with bayonets fixed and
drum beating, he asked how the inhabitants liked
the troops.
</p>

<p>
"'Ill enough,' answered the Royal, 'since we
shot some of them in a tithe business near Roscrea:
they have been as cold as charity, and the devil a
dinner or ball have we had since last muster day, and
you be here till you are mouldy without seeing such
a thing as a waltz or white kids&mdash;ices and fowl, trifle
and champagne.'
</p>

<p>
"Whereupon Mr. Jack Slingsby, being an Englishman,
and knowing no better, believed he might play
pranks upon the Irish; and seating himself in his
quarters next day, he assumed his pen and dispatched
the following card to every house in the town:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'Lieutenant Slingsby, of H.M.'s 6th Foot, presents
his compliments to the ladies of Kilkenny, and
takes the earliest opportunity of announcing his
arrival.  He begs to inform them that he can play
whist, casino, and every game on cards known in
Christendom; that he flirts to admiration, and can
polk, waltz, and dance the varsovienne ditto, that
generally he can accommodate himself to every
whim-wham of the charming sex, and is always to be
heard of at his residence in the infantry barracks.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Among others he rashly sent one of these precious
circulars to Mrs. Towler, the wife&mdash;I beg her
pardon&mdash;the lady of the major-general of the district,
who wickedly handed it to her husband at breakfast;
so poor Jack's production brought him before a
general court-martial.  It went very hard with him,
for the irascible general deemed that his wife and
her ten highly-eligible daughters were grossly
insulted; but our hero escaped with a reprimand, and
the colonel was directed to watch his conduct in
future, but he became thereafter the lion of Kilkenny
and Carlow to boot, and all the district from Roscrea
to Clonmel.  After that, an evening party without
Jack, would have been like a bell without a clapper."
</p>

<p>
"But the general never forgave me for that prank,"
said Jack, good-humouredly; "and he was always on
the watch for me afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"You remember how nearly he had you booked
for another court-martial on a race day?"
</p>

<p>
"And how nicely I outflanked and outwitted him!
It was the day of the principal races; I had a horse
to run, and more than half the regiment had made a
heavy book on him, and a great amount of paper
was expected to change owners on the issue.  The
lord-lieutenant was to be there, and I was all anxiety
to be present at the race, when, as the devil or the
adjutant would have it, I found myself in orders the
day before&mdash;orders for guard!  Everybody was going
to the course, and not a soul for love or money would
take my duty; so with a heavy heart I paraded in the
morning; and as the time for the start drew near I
saw all our fellows bowl out of barracks in drags and
cars attired in sporting mufti and in high spirits.
Then came old General Towler, commanding the
district, in his blue frogged coat, and with the sabre
which he had wielded at the passage of the Bidassoa,
Mrs. General Towler, several Misses Towler, all
demoiselles of mature age, and the A.D.C. Horatio
Towler, captain of a regiment which he never saw,
for he wisely preferred his mamma's drawing-room in
Kilkenny to broiling on Cape Coast.  They all scampered
out, then the barrack gates were shut, and all
became very quiet and still.
</p>

<p>
"No sound stirred in the empty parade-yard, for no
one was abroad; the sun was scorching and the
sentinels stood in their boxes.  I thought of the buzz,
the glitter, the fun and frolic, the cold fowl, the iced
champagne, the brandy and soda-water, the flirtation
on the roof of a drag, on the rumble or the dickey&mdash;all
the excitement and enthusiasm of the races, and
more than all, I imagined how my nag would look
when the exulting grooms drew his cloths off, the
jockey in blue and white colours, and fancy painted
him scouring like a whirlwind round the smooth
green course, and beating Flying Dutchman, Lady
Fanny, Albert, and all the rest of them hollow.
As the time of the start drew nigh, my excitement
and longing increased, but I knew too well the danger
of absenting myself from a guard.  I knew, moreover,
that old Towler, who spent half his life in laying
traps for subalterns (ensigns being his peculiar
aversion), was daily furnished with a card, whereon
were written the names of the officers on garrison
duty, and he had seen me on guard as he passed
out.  The barracks are so empty, I'll never be missed,
thought I, and may steal to the course in the crowd.
So, as the distance was short, I hurried off on foot
and in full uniform just as I had paraded for duty,
with my sword, white belt, and shako.  Lost amid
the wilderness of tents, stalls, thimblers, and rolypoly
men, carriages, gigs, cars, and vehicles of every kind,
I reached the grand stand, or rather its vicinity, and
was eagerly looking about for my horse as the bell
had rung at the starting-point, and the race had begun
long since, when I heard a tremendous cheer, and
saw my own jockey borne past me, shoulder high.
Blue and white had won!  In my excitement and
confusion I forgot all about my uniform, and was
pushing, jostling, and fighting my way through the
delighted mob, when the basilisk expression of two
fierce grey eyes that peered from under their shaggy
brows arrested me.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens and earth!  I was close to the carriage of
old General Towler, and there he sat, sullen as Jove
upon his throne of thunder clouds, scanning me and
his card,&mdash;the fatal detail card, alternately.
</p>

<p>
"'I am done for!' was my first thought; 'I have
won the race, but lost my commission; he has
nailed me at last!' and my heart sunk, as I thought
of the too probable consequences of a second
court-martial.
</p>

<p>
"'To the barracks,' I heard him say imperiously,
and I knew in a moment that he was deliberately
driving off to turn out the main guard, and thus to
prove me absent therefrom.  I felt that I was lost&mdash;that
my commission, the pride of my heart, was gone;
and had not a happy thought seized me, I should not
have been here to night.  Just as the carriage turned
round, I sprang up behind it, and stood there
unseen, but stooping low, because the roof was open.
</p>

<p>
"'You're sure it is that impertinent fellow, Slingsby,
of the Sixth?' said Mrs. Towler, with a smile of
malicious satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"'Sure as you are beside me, my love,' growled the
general; 'bad example to the soldiers&mdash;very! subversive
of all discipline&mdash;I'll smash him now&mdash;absent
from guard&mdash;a general court-martial&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'A saucy jackanapes,' said Miss Towler.
</p>

<p>
"'Gross dereliction of duty!'
</p>

<p>
"'He was most impertinent to Maria at the last
ball,' said Mrs. Towler.
</p>

<p>
"'Violation of the articles of war,' growled the
Major General; 'but here we are close on the
barracks&mdash;now we shall have him!'
</p>

<p>
"'Guard turn out!' cried the sentry, presenting
arms, and facing his post.
</p>

<p>
"'Stop, coachman,' cried the general, as the carriage,
with wheels flashing and its steaming bays at full
gallop, dashed up to the guard house, where they
reared back on their haunches, as the guard formed
line, opened ranks, and the drum gave the single
customary ruffle, just as I dropped unseen from the
foot-board behind, drew my sword, and took my place
coolly at the head of my men.
</p>

<p>
"'Sergeant,' roared the general; 'where's the
officer of the guard&mdash;where's that infernal&mdash;where is
Mr. Slingsby?'
</p>

<p>
"'Here, general,' said the astonished noncommissioned
officer.
</p>

<p>
"'I am here, sir,' said I, haughtily lowering the
point of my sword.
</p>

<p>
"'Here&mdash;you!' he exclaimed with a glance of
astonishment and perplexity, as he fumbled with his
confounded detail card; 'what the deuce&mdash;I thought&mdash;that
will do, however; guard, turn in, sir; coachman,
drive on!'
</p>

<p>
"And the carriage, with the general and all his
daughters, with their fringed parasols, rolled away.
Old Towler never discovered how I circumvented
him, though he assured his son, the aide-de-camp,
that he could have made his affidavit on seeing me
at the races, and in ten minutes after found me
at the head of my guard more than two miles
distant."
</p>

<p>
Next day Slingsby and I left the garrison on our
mission to Seville.  He accompanied me with some
reluctance, for he disliked the Spaniards, having been
frequently among them, and being one who possessed
a strange facility for getting into all kinds of scrapes
and broils.  Before starting we received from the
military secretary all the papers connected with the
affair of the guarda costa; and, what was of more
importance to us, we received from the paymaster a
necessary portion of "the soul of Pedro Garcias,"
and taking with us only our undress uniform and grey
great-coats, our swords and revolvers (for one might
as well travel without brains as without arms in Spain;
besides, Fabrique de Urquija, a devil of a fellow,
haunted the Sierra de Ronda), a valise with six shirts
each, a box of cubas, and a John Murray, we crossed
the isthmus, passed through the Spanish lines about
an hour after the morning gun was fired, and with the
gorgeous sunrise of a beautiful Spanish day took the
wild and lonely road into Andalusia, with well-filled
purses, good nags under us, light hearts and thoughtless
heads, and in such a frame of mind, that, in pursuit
of adventure, we would have faced anything, from a
black beetle to a mad bull.
</p>

<p>
I thought of Donna Paulina (when did I not think
of her?) and as the strong ramparts of Gibraltar
lessened in our rear, I hummed "Pues por bisarte
Minguillo," her coquettish little song of "The Kiss."
</p>

<p>
Poor Paulina!

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE VENTA.
</h3>

<p>
We had left the dull world of matter-of-fact behind
us, and were now in the land of romance, where, save
the invention of cigars and musket locks, all was
unchanged since the days of Charles V.; for while
all the world moves around her, Spain alone stands
still, torpid and unchanging as her unclouded sun and
mighty mountain Sierras.
</p>

<p>
On reaching Castellar we expected to receive an
escort from the officer commanding a troop of cavalry
quartered there, a necessary protection against the
banditti of Fabrique de Urquija, whose name was now
a terror to Andalusia.
</p>

<p>
It was a Spanish day; the air was clear, ambient,
and pure as light; the sky was cloudless, and
exhibited a deep immensity of blue, rendering the most
distant objects visible in the blaze of the soaring sun,
that whitened the rocks and the narrow horse path
we pursued; while the dark pine branches and
the light cork trees were unstirred by a breath of
wind.
</p>

<p>
We passed through San Roque, a town of some
importance to Spain, since Sir George Rooke in 1704
took Gibraltar, which was almost the only acquisition
of the English arms until the union with Scotland,
and consequent consolidation of the naval and military
resources of the two kingdoms.  After leaving it, our
route lay through that beautiful forest of cork trees
which spreads over a great part of the country, and
borders on the bay of Gibraltar.
</p>

<p>
At Venla we passed several strings of galley slaves,
who were chained together, and at work upon the
road.  As we trotted past, they paused to glare at us,
and their dark sparkling eyes shone through the tangled
masses of their jetty hair, which was the sole covering
of their heads alike under the winter rain and the
scorching summer sun.
</p>

<p>
At Castellar we were disappointed in our expected
escort, as the cavalry had marched to Seville, so we
halted at a venta, or inn, and were strongly advised by
the hostalero, or keeper, to tarry with him awhile, for
the approaching night at least, as several outrages had
lately been committed in the neighbourhood, and a
band of broken Carlist soldiers and runaway galley
slaves had hovered for some time in the Sierra de
Ronda, making themselves the terror of all the country
from Cortes to Vente Quemada.
</p>

<p>
"Disparate," said I; "nonsense!"
</p>

<p>
"A sly trick to get us to stay over night," said
Slingsby, as he took a long draught of Xeres and cold
water, and renewed his attack on the boiled fowl,
which was all the patron could as yet provide
for us.
</p>

<p>
"Madre maria purissima!" said the latter,
turning up his glossy black eyes; "may you be
forgiven your incredulity; but, señores, did you not
remark the number of crosses by the wayside as you
came along?"
</p>

<p>
"We did," said Jack; "and what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Each one marks the scene of some 'novedad.'"
</p>

<p>
"Novelty&mdash;a new term for a murder, Señor Patron?"
</p>

<p>
"And the poles, with robbers' heads on them?"
</p>

<p>
"I observed one," said I.
</p>

<p>
"And singular to say, a bird had built its nest in
it," added Jack; "it was a mere skull."
</p>

<p>
"One&mdash;madre de Dios&mdash;are there not a hundred? yet,
señores, you could not ride without an
escort, even so far as Alcala&mdash;the thing is not to be
thought of."
</p>

<p>
"What think you of all this sort of thing,
Ramble?" asked Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
Before I could reply, a loud cracking of whips, the
creaking of ill-greased wheels, and the clamour of voices
were heard.  On this the hostalero cried,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is the convoy already&mdash;the convoy from
Marbella to Medina&mdash;your graces will excuse me."
</p>

<p>
He hurried away, and in a minute after came
breathlessly back with intelligence that it had
been fired on by Don Fabrique with at least fifty
thousand banditti, at Benelauria, near the foot of the
Sierra, and but for a case of reliques carried by a
padre of Medina, every soul must have perished; but
would not the noble señores come down stairs, and
count the bullet-holes in the pannels?
</p>

<p>
"The bullet-holes!"
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, this affair becomes interesting," said
Slingsby, and we descended to the inn-yard, where
we found ourselves amid a Babel of tongues and dire
confusion.  Let the reader imagine four calessos, all
painted in bright stripes of red and yellow, the royal
colours of Spain, each with pannels full of glaring
flowers and absurd miraculous pictures, a body like a
cabriolet, supported on a ponderous under-carriage
with high wheels, all splashed with mud.  Each calesso
was drawn by two mules, the collars and bridles of
which were covered with clear jangling bells.  These
were each driven by a Jehu who wore all the brilliant
colours of the rainbow in his jacket, sash, breeches, and
embroidered leggings.  These four calessos were full
of passengers.  There were soap-boilers and potters
of Seville, sleek, well fed, and in easy circumstances;
the old padre, José Torquemada, the curate of Medina,
in a broad hat and long black cassock buttoned to the
throat; over his shoulders he wore a broad cape, and
in his hands were his beads, breviary, and the case of
reliques which had just been of such signal service.
There were several cotton manufacturers on their way
to Cadiz; but all&mdash;save a military man who wore a
green surtout and forage cap laced with gold&mdash;most
unwarlike personages to meet a party of robbers in a
Spanish sierra.
</p>

<p>
The drivers, we were told, were singing merrily,
the bells were jangling, the passengers all smoking,
chatting, and laughing, as they entered a defile in
the hills, when suddenly the rocks and trees which
overhung the rough path were found to be manned&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Don Fabrique de Urquija!" was the cry, shots
were fired&mdash;maladito! and the escort, which consisted
of a sergeant and four dragoons of the Spanish army,
turned their horses and fled at full speed, leaving
the convoy to the mercy of the outlaws, who captured
the rear calesso, cut its springs, shot the driver,
and had retained it with all its contents and
passengers.  The other four had escaped, and came
thundering down the narrow path to Castellar with
all their passengers shouting with terror, the mules
galloping, the bells jangling, and every vehicle
plunging like a ship in a storm.
</p>

<p>
"Morte de Dios!" added the military personage,
whom they called Don Joaquim, and from whom we
had this account; "it was a narrow escape, for
Urquija is a very Tartar&mdash;a blood-drinker!  You belong
to the British service, señores, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I.
</p>

<p>
"To the garrison in Gibraltar, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course; we have no other garrison in Spain."
</p>

<p>
"And you are on leave, señores?"
</p>

<p>
"Si, señor, on leave, and going to Seville," said
I, conceiving that to tell our real object to this
inquisitive officer might not be conducive to the
cultivation of mutual good-will.
</p>

<p>
"I also am an officer," said he, bowing; "and
belong to the Portuguese service&mdash;Major in the ancient
Regiment of St. Anthony."
</p>

<p>
"But you are a Spaniard," said I.
</p>

<p>
"The señor is right; but my father was tied to a
post one fine morning, and shot by Don Ramon de
Cabrera; it gave me a disgust at Spain, for I saw it
done, so I entered the service of Portugal.  Come,
hombres, I am glad to meet two brothers of the
sword; we shall have a fresh bota of Xeres, and be
comfortable for the night.  After this devilish piece
of work, the convoy cannot proceed without an
escort; it must halt till morning, so let us all be happy
together.  I shall be in Seville myself ere long, and
hope to have the pleasure of meeting you there."
</p>

<p>
Don Joaquim seemed to be about thirty-five years
of age; in figure he was somewhat short and punchy,
his face was round and good-humoured, though at
times it became stern, sinister, and almost fierce, if
anything excited him.  His hair was shorn short,
but his moustaches were long and lanky, and hung
over his mouth like black leeches, imparting to
his face an aspect not unlike the old portraits of
Philip II.  His light-green military surtout, like his
scarlet trousers, was edged with gold lace, and he
wore an enormous sabre, which clattered in a
scabbard of polished brass.  At a button-hole hung a
little order of merit; the bag, or end of his
forage-cap, drooped upon his right shoulder; his mouth
was never without one of those paper cigaritos of
which he was constantly employed in the manufacture
from a little paper book and tobacco bag; and
now I hope the reader sees before him, or her, Major
Don Joaquim of the Regiment of St. Anthony, otherwise
styled of Lagos.
</p>

<p>
The hostalero was in high spirits at the arrival
of so much good company, and being assured of
their detention for at least a night or two before the
escort could join them, he bustled about, applauding,
vociferating, and directing, while getting their
baggage, portmanteaux, and bales under cover, ever and
anon pausing to count or draw attention to seven or
eight bullet perforations which had been made in the
calesso panels, to the great perturbation of the
"easy-going" soap-boilers and "well-to-do" cotton merchants,
who had no taste or predilection for such matters, and
could not see how or why Don Joaquim considered
it such "a capital joke," that one had received a
bullet through his hat; another had received one
through the collar of his coat; and that a third had
his cigar&mdash;demonio&mdash;the very cigar carried out of his
teeth!
</p>

<p>
Soon we were all grouped together, some thirty or
so of us, in the large apartment of the venta, some
seated on stools, others on chairs, but many on piles
of baggage; bottles of vinto tinto, and skins of the
common wine, were set abroach; fresh cigars were
made up from those little pouches and paper books
which every Spaniard and Turk carry about with
him; Don Joaquim produced his guitar, and
favoured the company with a song.  To my surprise
it was Paulina's&mdash;"Pues por bisarte Minguillo"&mdash;and
we all became merry and noisy.  The soap-boiler
forgot the hole in his sombrero; the potter,
the dangerous mode in which he had lost his cigar,
even the old padre José relaxed his grim solemnity,
and slily relaxed the lower buttons of his long
cassock, to make more room for supper and the purple
contents of the thrice-blessed bota; while the
patrona, a buxom dame in a short skirt and scarlet
stockings, and wearing large silver ear-rings,
superintended the cooking of a vast dish of ham and
eggs&mdash;'huevos y tocino'&mdash;from which the fragrant steam
went hissing up the chimney, while the drivers in
their gaudy jackets sat near the glowing hearth,
chewing biscuits and bacalao, or roasting the sputtering
chestnuts, joining in our jokes and stories, while the
happy hostalero bustled about, superintending
everything and everybody.
</p>

<p>
The company of the convoy soon recovered from
the terror of their late adventure, and anxious
speculations or terrible surmises as to the fate of their
captured friends, sobered down into hopes that they
would soon join us; but the ruddy evening deepened
on the beautiful mountains of the Ronda; the darkening
peaks threw their shadows on the vine-clad plains,
the stars began to gleam in the dark blue vault, and
the last slice of ham and egg had sent its fragrance
up he wide chimney, but no fugitive reached the now
closed and barricadoed gate of the venta at Castellar.
</p>

<p>
As one may easily suppose, the late occurrence
caused the conversation to run very much upon
robbers and their exploits; thus we heard stories
of wanton cruelty sufficient to make the hair of a
well-regulated Briton stand erect on end; but as
these tales closely resembled the common stock of
robber narratives, especially such as we are told by
romancers, who have been smitten with what has
been termed the bandittiphobia, I will not attempt
to rehearse them all.  One or two of these relations
struck me as having something peculiar in them.
</p>

<p>
"I was once passing through Antequera," began
the venerable José Torquemada, "that city so famed
for robbers and picaros&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ay de mi! señor padre," said a goatherd of Honda,
"it was once famed lor something better."
</p>

<p>
"True, my child," replied the old priest, approvingly;
"for it was there Don Ferdinand the Just,
the valiant Infante of Castile, in the fifteenth century,
founded the noble order of the Jar of Lilies, in
honour of our Blessed Lady, by whose aid his good
and valiant knights stormed the city from the Moors,
and slew fifteen thousand of those God-abandoned
infidels.  Ah mi hijo! it was something to be a
Spaniard then!  But to return; I was once passing
through that same city of Antequera, when I had an
adventure with Don Fabrique&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"With Fabrique de Urquija?" exclaimed all,
drawing nearer the padre and lowering their voices.
</p>

<p>
"Ave Maria!" exclaimed Don Joaquim, "this
must indeed be something worth hearing."
</p>

<p>
"The more so, as I realised a pretty round sum
by it," continued the priest.  "You all know
Antequera, señores, a handsome town on the plain
between Granada and Seville, and situated in a land
that teems with oil and wine.  One night when the
hour was late, and no moon had risen, I was passing
through the great street which leads to the old
Moorish castle, and counting ever and anon in the
pocket of my cassock three poor pistareens, which
were all I possessed, but which I was hastening to
bestow upon a poor widow.  Her husband, a brave
guerilla, had been taken in a skirmish at the Pena
de los Enamorados (or Lover's Rock), which stands
a league from Antequera, and, after a brave
resistance, had been bound with cords, and shot that
morning in the Plaza&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By the Count de Morella?" cried Don Joaquim.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, by Cabrera."
</p>

<p>
"Bah&mdash;I thought so," said the major, grinding his
teeth; "proceed, reverend padre."
</p>

<p>
"The little pistareens were all I had in the world,
and when I thought of the poor widow and her six
children weeping by the corpse of their unburied
father, and unable to buy masses for his sinful soul,
I paused to gaze at the old castle of the Moors, and
sighed to know the secret of the treasures that lay
hid among its ruins; and then I craved pardon of
Madonna for the thought, as all the gold of the
infidels is buried under the spell of such
enchantment as no man may break and live.
</p>

<p>
"Well, señores, I was just thinking of these
strange things when a hand was laid heavily upon
my shoulder; I turned, and by the light of a shrine at
the corner of a street, saw a dark face and a tall figure
girdled by a scarlet sash full of daggers and pistols.
</p>

<p>
"'Who are you,' I asked fearlessly.
</p>

<p>
"'Fabrique de Urquija.'
</p>

<p>
"'Go, go,' said I, feeling my heart leap at the
name; 'I am but a poor priest, and can give you
nought but my blessing.'
</p>

<p>
"'Your blessing be hanged! señor padre, hand over
all you possess, or by the Holy Face of Jaen,'&mdash;and
grinding his teeth he grasped a poniard.
</p>

<p>
"'As I live I possess nothing but my cassock and
these poor little pistareens which are for a widow and
her starving children.'
</p>

<p>
"'Then off with the cassock, and give me the
pistareens to boot.  Your garment I must have, for I
mean to play the priest to-night, and visit a dame
whom I may make a widow, too, some of these days.'
</p>

<p>
"In vain I begged him to leave me the pistareens,
but this demon of avarice only laughed, and touching
his pistols said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Quick, quick, and here take my jacket and
maldito, begone without looking behind you.'
</p>

<p>
"The exchange was soon made; with a hoarse
laugh the robber thrust himself into my threadbare
cassock, and with loathing I drew on his old velvet
jacket, which was tattered and full of holes.  He then
bade me farewell with mock solemnity; and glad to
escape so easily I hastened away, but had not gone
many yards when I heard the voice of the terrible
Urquija commanding me to 'stop;' and believing
that, repenting of his clemency, he only meant to
poniard me, I turned and fled with all the spaed of
my poor old legs, fervently invoking the saints, and
praying to Madonna that the vision of the sacrilegious
pursuer might be obscured, and that I might
escape.
</p>

<p>
"'Come back, padre, come back, there is a mistake,'
I heard him crying; 'por vida del demonio,
stop, or it will be the worse for you!'
</p>

<p>
"But, blessed be Heaven, I escaped and reached the
humble house of the widow, where her little ones
gathered round me, and sought to clutch as usual
the long skirts of my cassock; but, ay de mi, they
were gone, and with them my pistareens, so that I
was without the means of buying bread for the
children of the dead guerilla.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do!" thought I, and mechanically
felt the pocket of the jacket; it contained
something hard: what is this!  I pulled it forth, and
Madre Maria! found the sudden cause of the robber's
oaths, pursuit, and vociferations, for by the exchange
of our apparel I had become the possessor of one
hundred golden pistoles!
</p>

<p>
"I had never held so much money in my hands
before; find for a long time I was quite bewildered
how to dispose of such a treasure.  First I made the
hearts of the widow and her little ones glad, and the
rest I bestowed on the poor old nuns of St. Theresa,
who had just been stripped of all they possessed in
the world, and were begging their bread in the public
streets of Antiquera&mdash;thanks to the liberal Government
of Spain."
</p>

<p>
The idea of the robber so egregiously outwitting
himself occasioned great satisfaction among all the
listeners; the goatherd was so delighted that he
thrice flung his hat up to the ceiling, and aloud 'viva'
greeted the old padre as he finished his little story.
</p>

<p>
"I once had a more narrow escape than yours,
Padre José," said the Major Don Joaquim, "and but
for the intervention of the blessed St. Anthony of
Portugal whose brother officer I have the felicity to
be, I had not had the happiness of addressing you
all to-night, or enjoying these roasted castanos, or the
most excellent vino tinto of the worthy señor patron."
</p>

<p>
"Through the intervention of San Antonio," exclaimed
all present; "do tell us, señor oficial, all about
this."
</p>

<p>
"You have heard of St. Anthony, señores?" said
the major to us.
</p>

<p>
"One of the seven champions of Christendom,
who broke enchantments, fought with giants, and did
all that sort of thing," said Slingsby; "of course,
who has not heard of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, who, indeed?" said the major.
</p>

<p>
His words smacked of a miracle, and every one
present became at once interested.  Lighting a fresh
cigar, and replenishing his wine-horn from the
big-bellied leathern bota, the major pushed his red
forage cap a little more on one side, fixed his dark
eyes on the glowing embers, and, with all the air
of a man who is rallying his forces to tell an
interesting narrative, began in the following words.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE REGIMENT OF SAN ANTONIO.
</h3>

<p>
You must know, Señora patrona, and señores, my
friends, that Saint Anthony, the patron of Portugal
and patriarch of monks, though born at Heraclea in
Upper Egypt, on the borders of Acadia, so long ago
as the third century, is now a member of the
battalion in which I have the honour to hold the
commission of major; and that he has been many times
visible in its ranks, mounting guard, and always when
under fire, or engaged with the French or Spaniards.
Under Wellington in the last war he was frequently
seen among our men, clad in a cloak of white wool,
and wearing an inner garment of hair-cloth, with a
bell tied to his neck, and a pig trotting beside him,
for it was his favourite animal when he was hermit
near the village of Coma.  When our esteemed regiment
was first embodied about a century and a half
ago at the city of Lagos, in the ancient kingdom of
Algarve, the blessed St. Anthony was enrolled in the
muster-book thereof, as a private soldier, that he might
be its especial patron and protector, even as he is the
patron of the whole Portuguese nation.
</p>

<p>
He conducted himself with such fidelity, valour, and
distinction, that he soon passed through the ranks of
corporal and sergeant, and having restored, no one
exactly knows how, the colours of the regiment, after
they were lost at the battle of Almanza in 1706, he
was appointed captain, and his pay, together with four
marevedis from each soldier, were devoted to buy
masses for the souls of our comrades who die on
service&mdash;a very pretty perquisite, padre José, for mother
church.
</p>

<p>
It would be a vain task in me to attempt enumerating
the miracles performed by St. Anthony during
the one hundred and eighty seven years he has
belonged to the valiant regiment of Lagos in the
kingdom of Algarve; for in danger, doubt, difficulty,
or death, his comrades have never sought his aid in
vain.
</p>

<p>
Our colours have been thrice lost in battle, after
prodigious slaughter you may be sure&mdash;being Portugese
colours; and were thrice restored to us, being
found quietly in the colonel's tent the next morning,
with the naked footmarks of a man and a pig&mdash;the
blessed pig of course&mdash;impressed upon the turf!
At the passage of the Guadalquiver, our drum-major
was swept away and would have been drowned beyond
a doubt, had he not called upon St. Anthony; and
lo! an old man of most venerable aspect, clad in
skins like this shepherd beside us, but with a long
beard and leathern water-bottle hanging at his girdle,
suddenly appeared among the reeds by the river side,
and stretching out his crook, fished up the ponderous
Anibale Pintado lightly as a straw, though he was at
that moment in heavy marching order, with knapsack,
blanket, great-coat, sword and his canteen, which was
full of brandy.  Then to think of the wounds that
have been closed, the bullets that have been extracted,
the bones that have been set, the sick made whole
and fit for service, by our soldiers merely thinking on,
or praying to, the glorious St. Anthony, would occupy
all the paper in the kingdom of Algarve; but his
crowning miracle was the birth of a child of the
regiment, for one of our soldiers' wives being in labour,
during the siege of Roses, and calling upon the saint
in her pain, to the astonishment of the whole allied
armies was delivered of a little drummer boy in the
uniform of the battalion of Lagos!  I hope I have
now said enough to convince you that the regiment,
and every member of it, are under the peculiar
protection of the saint, and this, as I am about to have
the honour of telling you, I experienced myself,
although not a Portugese, but a native of the fair city
of Seville; and as a further proof of what I have
adduced, I will take the liberty of reading to you from
my pocket-book, the following certificate of the
military service performed by the saint&mdash;which
certificate I copied fairly from the books of the noble
regiment of Lagos in the kingdom of Algarve, being
the document which was forwarded by one of my
predecessors, then in command of the battalion, when
recommending the blessed saint to further promotion
from the rank of captain which he had held since the
year 1706.  (With this long and pompous flourish,
the Spaniard opened his pocket-book, and read a
translation from the Portugese, which ran as follows.)*
</p>

<p>
"Don Herculeo Antonio Carlos Luiz, José Maria
de Albuquerque e Arajo de Magalhaens Homem, noble
of Her Majesty's household, cavalier of the sacred
order of St. John of Jerusalem, and of the most
illustrious the military order of Christ, lord of the
towns and partidos of Moncarapacho and Terragudo,
hereditary alcalde-mayor of the ancient city of Faro
by the sea, and Major of the Regiment of Infantry of
the noble city of Lagos in the kingdom of Algarve,
for her most faithful majesty, Donna Maria, Francesco
Isabella the first; whom God and the Blessed Virgin
long preserve, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
"I hereby attest and certify to all who shall see
these presents, signed at the bottom with my sign-manual,
and the broad seal of my family arms a little
to the left thereof, that the Lord St. Anthony of
Lisbon (commonly and most falsely called of Padua)
has been enlisted, and has borne a place in this
regiment since the 24th of January, ever since the year of
our Blessed Lord Jesus Christ 1668.
</p>

<p>
"I do further certify, upon my word of honour, as
a noble, a knight, and a good Catholic, what hereunder
followeth.
</p>

<p>
"That on the said 24th of January, 1668, by order
of His Majesty Don Pedro II. (whom God hath in
glory), then Regent of the valiant kingdoms of
Portugal and Algarve for Don Alphonso VI.,&mdash;St. Anthony
was duly enlisted as a private soldier in this Infantry
Regiment of Lagos, when it was first formed by command
of the same illustrious prince; and of that holy
enlistment there is a register extant in vol. i. of the
records of the said regiment, page 143, wherein he gave
as security or caution for his good conduct, the queen of
angels, who became answerable to the colonel that he
would never desert his colours, but always behave as
became a good Portugese grenadier.  Hence did the
saint continue to serve and do duty as a private until
the 12th of March, 1683, on which day the same Prince
Regent became King of Portugal by the death of his
brother Don Alphonso VI., when he was graciously
pleased to promote St. Anthony to the rank of Lieutenant
of Grenadiers in the said regiment, for having,
a short time before, valiantly put himself at the head,
of a detachment of the regiment which was marching
from Jurumenha to the garrison of Olivença, both in
the province of Alentizo, and beat off four times their
number of Castilians who had been lying in ambush
for them, with the intention of carrying them all
prisoners to the castle of Badajoz, the enemy having
obtained information by spies, of the march of the
said detachment, every soldier of which saw our
blessed patron, visibly, and to all appearance in the
body, and attended by his pig.
</p>

<p>
"I do further certify, that in all the above-cited
registers, there is not any note of St. Anthony being
guilty of bad conduct, disorder, or drunkenness;
frequenting taverns, or other improper places; nor of
his ever having been flogged or sent to the guard-house
when a private: Thus during the whole time
he has been an officer, now about one hundred and
nine years, he has constantly done his duty with the
greatest alacrity, at the head of the grenadiers, upon
all occasions, in peace or war, conducting himself like
an officer and a gentleman of good breeding; on all
these accounts I hold him most worthy of being
promoted to the rank of aggregate-major to our noble
regiment of Lagos, with every other favour Her Majesty
may be graciously pleased to bestow upon him.  In
testimony whereof, I have hereto affixed my name, at
the Castle of Belem, this 25th day of March, in the
year of our redemption, 1777.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MAGALHAENS HOMEM."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
(Thus ended this wonderful certificate, the contents
of which, together with the pompous gravity of the
reader, made Jack and I almost choke with
suppressed laughter.  The major then continued)&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Hereupon Her Most Faithful Majesty, who reigned
at that time&mdash;now seventy-eight years ago&mdash;was pleased
to promote the saint to the rank prayed for, and he is
now our lieutenant-colonel by brevet.  Once in each
year it is the custom to send an officer to Lisbon to
receive the pay and perquisites of St. Anthony from
the royal treasury, and in the course of last year this
most honourable duty devolved upon me.
</p>

<p>
We were then quartered at Barbacena in the jurisdiction
of Elvas; and to this place I travelled alone
from Lisbon, with the pay of the saint, which was to
be given to the care of our chaplain.  Being in
moidores, it was not very bulky, but its value was
great&mdash;its sanctity greater; and after traversing in
safety the whole province of Alentijo, it was with
some anxiety I saw the mountain Sierra, which lay
between me and my destination, rising in my front,
about sunset.  The hope of being able to get across
those rocky hills before the approaching night set
fairly in never occurred to me.  I found myself in a
solitary spot, without shelter near, or any place where
information of the right way could be gathered, and
my horse was growing weary.
</p>

<p>
The sunlight died away behind me, and shed its
last rays on the white walls, the square campanile
and tall cypresses of a convent which crowned a
height on my left; and on the red round towers of
an old castle that topped a rock on my right; but
both were in ruins and desolate, as the wars of the
infidel Moors, ages ago, had left the first, and the
desolating retreat of Marshal Massena had left the
second.  The older fragments of a Roman aqueduct
lay between, and half hidden among wild shrubs.
The pathway was rugged; untamed goats scrambled
about; snakes hissed in the long grass, and eagles
screamed in mid air.  Ave Maria! it was impossible
to conceive a place more dreary and desolate; but the
way became still wilder, and as I progressed into the
gorge of the Sierra, even the ruined works of man
and the traces of his feet disappeared.  I was in a
desert, and, save the faint crescent moon, without a
light or guide.
</p>

<p>
As I rode slowly on, thinking of the bright golden
moidores of our Lord St. Anthony, with which my
pouch was blessed, and reflecting on the prize they
would be for any sacrilegious picaros who might be
hovering in this dark wilderness, ever and anon
humming a song, muttering an ave, and feeling the
percussion caps on my pistols, I suddenly met a strange
figure in the dim moonlight&mdash;a goat-herd, as he
seemed to me.
</p>

<p>
He was clad in a zamarra of sheepskin, which he
wore with the wool outwards; his white hair hung in
tangled masses upon his shoulders; a bota was slung
at his girdle, and he carried a stout Portuguese cajado,
with a little cross stick nailed thereon, to give it more
the aspect of a pastoral staff, than a weapon of defence.
</p>

<p>
"Vaya usted con Dios, Señor Major," said he.
</p>

<p>
"God be with you," I reiterated, a little scared on
finding that this stranger knew my name; "you have
the advantage of me, Señor Pastor."
</p>

<p>
"Hombre, do you think so? but do not be alarmed,
for I am an old Christian, without stain of Moor or Jew
in my veins.  I am no enchanter&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ave Maria, I should hope not!"
</p>

<p>
"Yet I know that you have in your pouch the pay
of St. Anthony of Lisbon, whom rogues and fools
style of Padua&mdash;what the devil should he have to do
with Padua?&mdash;in your left breast pocket, all in fair
round moidores of gold&mdash;eh, señor?"
</p>

<p>
"Very true, pastor," said I, slipping a finger into
my near holster, and keeping my horse well in hand
and beyond the reach of his cajado; "but how came
you to know me?"
</p>

<p>
"I know every officer and soldier in the regiment
of Lagos as well as if I had made them&mdash;and you
especially, Señor Major."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;and about the moidores," said I, uneasily;
"you know of them, and what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Merely this, Señor Don Joaquim; that if you
would arrive at Barbacena to-morrow with the pay of
the patron of the regiment of Lagos&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In the kingdom of Algarve," suggested Jack
Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"Si, señor; and would hand it over safe and sound
to the reverend chaplain," continued the old man, in
a manner so impressive that a chill came over me, the
more so as I saw his sunken eyes shining in the dim
moonlight like two bits of green glass; "you will
beware, my son and comrade, how you taste the wine
of Xeres to-night."
</p>

<p>
"The wine of Xeres, father pastor," said I, with a
loud laugh; "Heaven forgive you for the tempting
thought; I am not likely to taste aught to-night but
the chilling dew; yet if a good cup of Xeres did come
my way&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Avoid it as you would poison, or by the soul of
St. Anthony you will repent it."
</p>

<p>
At that name I raised my hand to my cap in salute,
like a good soldier of the regiment of Lagos; while
waving his hand authoritatively, the old man hobbled
up the slope of the mountain pass and disappeared.
As he did so I heard the tinkle of a bell, and for the
first time perceived a little pig trotting by his side as
he vanished in the shadow of the mountain and its
moonlit rocks.
</p>

<p>
The scales fell from my eyes; por el Santo de los
Santos, he was no other than our Lord Saint
Anthony, whom I had seen.  Who but he would have
termed me "son and comrade?" sinner and fool that
I was.  The hair of my flesh stood up, as the
Scripture says, and with a prayer on my lips I gored my
poor nag with the spurs and dashed along the pass of
the Sierra for two leagues more until the poor animal
almost sank beneath me; but perceiving rest necessary
for him, I reined up at the door of a lonely wayside
inn, in a part of the country which was entirely
unknown to me, and which seemed to be overshadowed
by mountain peaks and masses of rock, the features
and outlines of which were strange, and to me gloomy
and fantastic.  In my excitement, and the holy terror
under which I laboured, I had evidently lost the path,
and thus mistaking my way, had ridden, Heaven and
St. Anthony alone knew whither.
</p>

<p>
Solitary, dark, and desolate as this posada seemed,&mdash;and
it was just the kind of place we so often read
of in romances as being a rendezvous for robbers, and
for having a landlord in their interest, with trap-doors
under the beds, stains of blood upon the floors, old
skeletons in the cellars, and a terrible reputation for
mysterious appearances and unaccountable
disappearances&mdash;it was a welcome halting-place for one so
weary, so thirsty, and anxious as I was then, and so
full of supernatural fear, as I never, for an instant,
doubted having seen the blessed patron of our
regiment, and to me at that time the human countenance
even of a robber had been thrice welcome.
</p>

<p>
Though the hour was late the hostalero had not
gone to bed.  He seemed a civil and respectable
man, and smiled with good-humour when he saw me,
with all the care of an old traveller and the suspicion
of a true Spaniard, transfer my pistols from their
holsters to my girdle, a movement which seemed to
fill with alarm the miserable and drabbish-looking
Maritornes, who seemed to be the sole assistant of the
patrona.  Vague fancies and a sense of alarm were
floating uppermost in the current of my thoughts;
and being most anxious to start betimes when day
broke, I left the saddle on my horse, as I stabled
him in the lower apartment of the posada, for you
may know, señores, that the Portuguese inns are
constructed exactly like those among us here in Spain,
the lower story being entirely one vast and
clay-floored chamber, appropriated to the cattle and
baggage of travellers.  I merely relaxed the
saddle-girth and curb-chain, but left my Andalusian jennet
all ready for marching, when the morning came, and
then ascended by a wooden trap-stair to the upper
story, where the patrona had a steaming supper of
ham and eggs, just such as we have had, well
seasoned with pepper and garlic, spread for me, with a
bunch of raisins and a choice flask of&mdash;ah, demonio! my
heart leaped when I saw it&mdash;the wine of Xeres de
la Frontierra.
</p>

<p>
A prayer rose to my lips, I thought of St. Anthony,
but felt strong and composed, believing that I
was under the peculiar care of that blessed patron of
the regiment of Lagos.  I would have left the little
venta and betaken myself once more to the road, but,
if any snare was really laid for me, such a movement
might only render me more liable to an open and
deliberate attack.
</p>

<p>
"I will be wary," thought I; "let me watch well,
even as our holy patron watches me.  Xeres! ouf,
I would rather drink the salt lake of Fuente de la
Piedra than touch a drop of it."
</p>

<p>
I felt morally certain that it was poisoned or drugged
for some fatal purpose, and that in the tasting of it
lay the main part of my danger.  I finished the rasher
of ham and the fragrant huevos; and to lull all
suspicion asked my host to join me in discussing the
bottle of Xeres as he uncorked it.
</p>

<p>
"The señor would, perhaps, excuse him.  Xeres
always made him ill, maldito&mdash;yes, and there was no
doctor nearer than Elvas or Abrantes; but he would
take a glass of aguadiente to my health and
successful journey."
</p>

<p>
"Rascally picaro!" thought I; "you have other
reasons for declining the Xeres, but I shall mar them
yet."
</p>

<p>
I might have forced him with my sword at his
throat to drink a cupful; but I dissembled, and filling
out a bumper from the leathern beta, raised it to my
lips, pretending to taste.  I saw, then, the slow
stealthy eyes of the hostalero watching me keenly.
</p>

<p>
"It has a peculiar flavour," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Flavour, señor?" he asked, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"But not unpleasant."
</p>

<p>
"It is from the grapes of Puerto de Santa Maria,
like those of Tribujena, as the Señor Caballero will
perceive; they have a peculiar flavour&mdash;sharp, is it
not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but as I said before, not unpleasant," continued
I, placing my pistols on the table, and availing myself
of an opportunity to pour the whole of my bumper
back into the bota, and this I achieved unseen.  Some
grounds which remained at the bottom of the crystal
glass assured me that the wine was drugged.
</p>

<p>
"I have a pigskin full of wine from the grapes of
Don Carlos, or rather I should say of my Lord the
Marquis de Santa Cruz, who now owns the vineyard;
and if your grace&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks," said I, pouring out a second
bumper, so that the wine frothed in the glass; "but be
assured I shall content myself with this most excellent
bottle of Xeres," and taking another opportunity,
while the patrona was telling her beads near the fire,
and the worthy patron was below pretending to groom
my horse&mdash;but no doubt to appraise its furniture which
he expected to possess before morning&mdash;I repeated the
manoeuvre, and poured the wine back into its leathern
receptacle; thus my deluded entertainers were led to
believe that I had taken enough to drug a regiment
of Asturians.
</p>

<p>
I scrutinised my hostess; she was a swarthy and
dark-skinned Portuguese; her hair, which was coarse
and thick as the mane of a steed, she had knotted
in a coronet round her head, and over this she wore a
yellow shawl.  Her features were square, massive, and
repulsive; and her arms and legs, which her scanty
garments fully displayed, were disgustingly powerful
and muscular.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not somewhat lonely here, señora?" I
asked, when her orisons were over.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but then we are never disturbed.  Once,
indeed, some drunken contrabandistas, riding to
Gibraltar, made a noise at our door; but my husband
shot one with his escopeta, the rest fled, and we have
never been molested since.  But erelong the new
railway from Lisbon to Abrantes will change
everything&mdash;for so the priests predict."
</p>

<p>
"You talk of this little shooting affair with delightful
coolness," said I, "and just as if that devil of a
contrabandista had been a crow.  Ah, and so he was
shot?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and buried about a mile beyond this," replied
the woman, over whose dark eyes there passed a
savage gleam; "perhaps, caballero, you observed the
cross as you came along?"
</p>

<p>
"You forget that I came this morning from Montemor
o Novo, where I wish I had stayed with all my
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, our caza is a very poor one, señor," growled
the host, with a glance at my glass and another at the
bota: "but none ever complain of it after they leave us."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you, my lad," said I, with a glance at the
cuchillo in his sash; madre mia! it was at least twelve
inches long in the blade.  He detected my expression
and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am always well armed, Señor Caballero, for my
little wife, our niece, and I, are the only inhabitants
here.  They are apt to be timid at times; thus I
always keep my escopeta loaded, and six junkets of
lead in that old brass-mouthed trabujo over the
mantel-piece; so with my knife and strong bolts, bars
and shutters, we could stand a very good siege, even
if Don Fabrique de Urquija and all his band were
assailing us.  One glass more of the Xeres before you
retire, señor&mdash;no?&mdash;well, how such a sober Caballero
belongs to the regiment of Lagos surpasses my&mdash;a
thousand pardons, señor; I meant no offence; but a
poor man must have his little joke as well as a rich
one, and I am sure a noble Caballero will excuse it.
So you won't take one glass more of the Xeres before
retiring, well, well&mdash;this way, señor, up this stair&mdash;take
care of the step, and now, señor, Bueno noches,
and may all good attend you."
</p>

<p>
I was alone.  I was in my sleeping apartment, a
miserable loft, to which I had ascended by means of
a trap-door and trap-stair.  The bed was poor and
shabby; a thousand discolorations, the combined
result of damp and dirt covered the ill-plastered walls
and bare wooden floor.  A small and ill-glazed
window opened to the dark mountains, behind which the
moon, a pale crescent, was just sinking, and to the
deep black gorge which yawned between their peaks
like some vast Titan's grave.  There was not a sound
upon those solemn hills, or in that savage pass through
which the roadway wound; there was no sound in
the posada below me, and as I set down the candle
and listened, I heard only its sputtering and the
beating of my own heart.
</p>

<p>
I knelt down, and drawing forth my beads and
crucifix, said my prayers like a good Catholic, and
solemnly invoked the protection of St. Anthony.
After this, apprehension almost vanished.
</p>

<p>
If any attempt was made upon me in the night, I
had but one man to oppose&mdash;the hostalero, and surely
I was a match for him.  But then there was his wife,
a powerful Asturian termagant, who had doubtless the
cunning of a fox with the strength of a bull.  I looked
about for something wherewith to secure the trapdoor,
but found nothing; my bedstead was the only
piece of furniture, and it was too weighty for removal.
I might have lain down and slept above the trap; but
the idea did not then occur to me; and at times, as
my candle burned low, such is the weakness of the
human heart, that I began to mistrust even the
protection of my Lord St. Anthony, and think I was
unwise in not quitting this unblessed posada, instead of
retiring to a bed-chamber, as the hostalero might be
joined by others more ruffianly than himself, and
thus overpower me.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," thought I; "no others will come; the
rascal trusts in his Xeres, and I shall soon see the
sequel."
</p>

<p>
I drew off my boots and flung them heavily on the
floor, as one might do who was undressing; and
having thus, as I supposed, deceived any one who was
listening, drew them carefully on again; tightened
the buckle of my waist-belt, and loosened my good
Toledo sabre in its sheath.  I then examined my
pistols; ay de mi! what were my emotions on finding
the percussion caps removed, and that my pouch,
with the remainder, was in my holsters below!
</p>

<p>
My heart stood still on beholding this, and an
emotion of rage shook my heart, for I now
remembered having laid them on the table beside me in
case of accident, for I once had a friend who was
killed by a pistol exploding in his belt.  The patrona,
while laying the supper table, or bustling about me,
had adroitly&mdash;but the saints alone know how&mdash;removed
the caps.
</p>

<p>
Twenty times I searched every pocket, in the faint
and desperate hope of finding a stray one.  Not
one&mdash;they were all below with my holsters.
</p>

<p>
"Ass that I am!" thought I, replacing them with a
sigh in my belt; "this will be a lesson of prudence
that may cost me dear."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the candle-end sank down in the
iron holder; it shot one red flush upwards on the
cobwebbed ceiling and damp, discoloured walls; on
the ill-jointed trap-door which led to the lower story,
and expired.  I was in darkness at last, with no
companions but my Toledo and my own thoughts.
The first was silent&mdash;the second sufficiently
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Sleepless and watchful, I lay on the miserable
pallet for more than an hour, till the silence began
to oppress me, and in spite of myself, my eyes were
closing.  Could it be the drug&mdash;could it be the wine
that slowly was sealing them up?  Nonsense; I had
but put it to my lips, and I struggled to shake off
the coming sleep.  Yet, I must have closed my eyes
for a moment, for I started suddenly, like one who
dreams he is on the brink of a precipice.  A strange
shivering&mdash;a minute, pricking sensation ran all over
me from head to foot, and from a state of drowsiness,
I sprang all at once to the sharpest wakefulness, and
grasped the hilt of my drawn sabre.
</p>

<p>
A dim light was now ascending from the floor of
the apartment, and I perceived the trap-door was
lifted up, and the round bullet-head of the hostalero
appeared, with his deep-set stealthy eyes, scanning
the bed and its occupant, myself, who affected to be
sound asleep.  Up, up he came, step by step, until
he stood by my side, with one hand grasping his long
cuchillo, and a finger on his coarse, blubber-like lips,
as if he would impose silence on himself, and still
his very breathing.
</p>

<p>
Mueran del Demonio, what a moment it was!  I
would not endure it again for a million of reals.  He
came close to the bed; he stooped over me, the knife
was lifted up, and I saw its baleful gleam; but at the
same instant there was an upward flash, as I swept
my sabre round me, and one stroke cut off three of
the robber's fingers, and cleft a fair slice off his right
temple&mdash;a stroke which stretched him without a cry
at my feet.  Desperate and furious as a wild beast&mdash;half
blinded with his own blood, he sprang upon me
and we grappled in the dark; but as his wife, that
diabolical Asturian, rushed up the trap-stair, armed
with a ponderous cajado, to his aid, I flung him on
the bed, for he was weak as a child now.  Seeing a
figure struggling on the miserable pallet, the woman,
who was as furious as an enraged tigress, and who, in
the uncertain light, believed that figure to be mine,
whirled round her head the cajado&mdash;which is the
favourite staff of the Portuguese, and is usually seven
feet long, with a leaden knob at one end of it&mdash;and
by one blow dashed out her husband's brains as
completely as a cannon-ball would have done.
</p>

<p>
Madre mia, some of that frightful mess flew over
me, and that blow ended the matter, for I uttered a
cry of horror, and plunging down the trap-stair, threw
myself on my horse, and galloped away.  On, on I
rode, with no wish but to leave that scene of crime
behind me, and at the very place where I was met
by that venerable shepherd, whom, until my dying
hour, I will maintain to be no other than our blessed
St. Anthony, but for whose warning I had drunk that
poisoned Xeres, and perished&mdash;I overtook a troop of
the Carbineros of Alentejo, to whom I told my late
adventure.
</p>

<p>
A party was sent to the little inn, where they found
the hostalero brained, as I have said, in that miserable
loft, and the hostess almost bereft of her senses, such
as they were.  But the dragoons placed her on a
troop horse, and brought her before the Alcalde of
Vimiero, which is the nearest town, and before the
next day's noon, she had been garotted and buried
by the wayside; and you may still see her grave, one
mile beyond the gates, on the side of the way that
leads towards Estremoz and the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Two days after, I reached Barbacena, our headquarters,
in safety, and paid over to our Father Chaplain,
the purse of moidores, containing the pay of
our extra Lieutenant-Colonel, the blessed St. Anthony.
Only a month ago, we marched through the
pass of the Sierra, and I found the old posada roofless
by the roadside, for it is shunned like that place
of horror, the Rio de Muerte; the grass has grown
on its floor, and the wild vine overtops its chimney;
the merriest muleteer becomes silent as he passes
the place, and whips his lagging team down the
mountain side, without looking once behind him.
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The major of the noble Regiment of Lagos now
paused, and looked round with the air of a man who
thinks his story has rather made an impression; for
he had told it well, and with much gesture and
spirit, and completely succeeded in arresting the
attention of all in the venta; but of none more than
my matter-of-fact friend Jack Slingsby, who had
listened to the narrative with a degree of attention
which I thought unusual in one so volatile and heedless.
</p>

<p>
"Your story, major, has had a peculiar interest for
me by its striking and close resemblance to an
adventure of my own," said Jack, "an adventure to which
I can never recur without an emotion of horror."
</p>

<p>
"Is this the Spanish story you so often refer to,
Jack?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"The story our mess could never get out of me?&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"And shall we hear it now?"
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure; because it will interest all here,
whereas among our own bantering fellows at Gibraltar
it would only have subjected me, perhaps, to jibes and
jokes, and all that sort of thing, from those who were,
perhaps, more thoughtless than myself.  Señora
patrona, please to have the wine replenished; give us
more cigars, and stir up the fire, Ramble, while I
prepare to tell you a story&mdash;aye, a marvel of a story, in
which I had the misfortune to be a principal actor not
very long ago."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" muttered every one.
</p>

<p>
All were provided with a fresh supply of wine, new
cigars were lighted, and Jack found himself the centre
of a circle of dark, gleaming, and intelligent eyes,
while every ear was waiting for the promised narrative;
for among the romantic, adventurous, and marvel-loving
Spaniards, as among the wandering Arabs, a story-teller
is at all times the principal person in company.
</p>

<p>
It would be scarcely possible to find a scene more
remarkable, or a group more picturesque, than the
great apartment presented, in which we were all
congregated.
</p>

<p>
A large fire blazed on its broad hearth, and shed a
ruddy glow upon the rough architecture and ill-squared
beams of the chamber, from the roof of which hung
innumerable bunches of raisins, strings of the garlic
onion, pigskins of wine, hams, baskets, and other
etcetera.  The flood of steady red light that gushed
from the hearth glared on the striking forms and
foreign faces of the listening group, among whom
were the well-conditioned potters and soap-boilers of
Seville in their black velvet jackets and gaudy sashes;
our patrona, a plump and pretty paisana of Valverde,
in her provincial costume, a dark blue skirt, the
scantiness of which displayed her well-turned legs and
handsome feet encased in little shoes of untanned
leather, while the gathered masses of her smooth
black hair shone in the glow of light; there, too, sat
the old padre José of Medina in his sable cape and
long cassock, and a grisly goatherd of the Honda clad
from neck to knee in sheepskins, with a weatherbeaten
sombrero slouched over his sallow visage; a knife and
bota, castanets and flute, at his girdle, to which descended
his snow-white beard, giving him the aspect of
St. Anthony in the major's story; then there was the
major himself in his light green frock-coat, scarlet
cap and trowsers, with a cigar glowing like a hot coal
in the centre of his heavy thick mustache; then there
was an old unhoused Franciscan, begging for that
subsistence of which the new Government had deprived
his order; a charming young Gitana, tall and beautiful
in form, with a clear olive complexion and magnificent
eyes; and by her side sat a free, jolly Catalan reaper,
whom in defiance of all gypsy rule and immemorial
custom she had taken as her spouse; so it must be
acknowledged that if Jack's audience was not select, it
had at least the merit of being so remarkable in
costume and character, that a painter or novelist would
have been delighted with the whole group, its
background, and accessories.
</p>

<p>
"In many of its features," said Slingsby, "my story
is so similar to the one just related by the major, that
I am assured you cannot fail to be struck with the
resemblance.  The adventure made a deep impression
upon me; and though several months have passed
since it occurred, the whole affair is as fresh in my
mind as if it had happened only yesterday.  On
leaving the 6th Regiment," continued Jack, turning to
me, "I went for a few months into the Highlanders,
but, being an Englishman, I never felt at home in the
kilt, so I exchanged into our present corps, which will
account for my being in the Mediterranean at the time
referred to.&mdash;So now for the story."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, señor!" said the major of the regiment
of Lagos; "you speak Spanish like a good Christian.
We are all attention."
</p>

<p>
Jack bowed, stuck his glass in his eye, tipped the
ashes off his cigar with the nail of his forefinger, and
began the following story, which deserves an entire
chapter devoted to itself.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
LA POSADA DEL CAVALLO.
</h3>

<p>
In the summer of last year, I was proceeding home to
Britain on leave of absence from my regiment, the &mdash;th
Highlanders, which were then, and are still, lying in
garrison at Malta.  Favoured by the friendship of her
commander, and my good friend and old school-fellow,
Lieutenant John Hall, I had a passage given to me in
Her Majesty's Sloop Blonde, of twenty-six guns; and
after a pleasant run for a few days, a smart breeze,
which we encountered off Almuneçar, when sailing
along the coast of Spain, brought down some of our
top hamper, and we ran in to Malaga to repair the
damage.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful and sunny evening when our
anchor plunged into the shining waters of that deep
bay which presents so superb a line of coast, and the
background of which is formed by the undulating
line of the Sierra de Mija towering into the pure blue
sky of Spain, and bounding, in the distance, the flat
and fertile Vega.
</p>

<p>
From the quarter-deck of the Blonde, we had a
magnificent prospect of Malaga, with its stately
mansions, its domes, its spires and snowy kiosks, bathed
in a warm yellow tint as the sun's rays faded along
the Vega, and the shadows deepened on its hills,
clothed with vineyards and plantations of orange,
almond, lemon and olive trees.  The gaudy Spanish
flag descended from the dark ramparts of the old
Moorish fortress of Gibral-Faro as the evening gun
was fired from the guard-ship; and then, as the sun
set behind tha mountains, the bells tolled for vespers
in the lofty steeple of the square Cathedral, and a
red lambent light began to glimmer on the tall brick
chimneys of that extensive iron-foundry, which (alas
for romance!) a thoroughly practical Scotsman has
built in Malaga, where it finds food and work for
hundreds, in smelting the ore of the adjacent hills, while
it pollutes the cerulean sky of Granada.
</p>

<p>
Bent upon a ramble or adventure, the second-lieutenant
(Jack Hall) and I took our fowling-pieces,
and, leaving our swords behind us&mdash;at least I took
only my regimental dirk&mdash;were pulled ashore in the
dingy, which landed us at one of those piers that
project from the city into the sea, forming part of that
noble mole which measures seven hundred yards in
length.
</p>

<p>
Leaving our guns and shooting apparatus at our
hotel, we wandered about the town; visited the
Alcazaba, which must once have been a fortress of vast
strength; then the old Roman Cathedral and Bishop's
Palace; but we lingered longest in the Alameda&mdash;that
beautiful promenade&mdash;which is eighty feet wide,
and is bordered by rows of orange and oleander trees,
and in the centre of which a magnificent marble
fountain was tossing its sparkling waters into the
starry sky.
</p>

<p>
Here we saw some bright-eyed Spanish women in
their dark mantillas and veils, and not a few in tha
homely and assuredly less graceful bonnet and shawl
of London and Paris, whose fashions are gradually,
and, I think, unfortunately, superseding the more
captivating dress of old Spain; we saw too,
ferocious-looking soldiers in dark dresses, weaving yellow
sashes, red forage caps, and enormous moustaches;
old priests gliding stealthily along, with an aspect of
meekness, and apparently crushed in spirit; for the
Government presses with a heavy hand on the
ecclesiastics; citizens clad in light stuffs of bright
colours, with red sashes and low-crowned hats, having
black silk tufts at each side; queer-looking Caballeros
in large brown cloaks like that of Don Diego de
Mendoza's "Poor Hidalgo," and wearing hats 'à la
Kossuth.'  As every man was smoking as if his salvation
depended upon his doing so with vigour, the whole
air was redolent of cigars.
</p>

<p>
I had on my undress, a forage cap, and plain red
jacket, with tartan trews, my sash and dirk; for I
have found that the British uniform always ensures the
wearer attention and respect in every part of the globe.
</p>

<p>
We wandered long in that lovely Alameda, until
the last of its fair promenaders had withdrawn; and
then we returned to our hotel rather disappointed,
that of all the black eyes we had seen flashing under
veils of Madeira lace, not one had given us a glance
of encouragement; that of all the pretty lips, which
had been lisping dulcet Spanish mixed with the Arabic
of Granada, none had invited us to follow; that of
all the sombre cavaliers, not one appeared to be an
assassin or a Grand Inquisitor; and that, of all the
hideous old duennas whom we had seen cruising
about us, not one had approached, and with finger on
her lip, and an impressive glance in her eye, placed a
mysterious note into either of our hands, and
"disappeared in the crowd."
</p>

<p>
Nothing remarkable happened, save that Hall had
his pocket picked of his handkerchief and cigar-case,
and we returned like other men to our hotel, where
we supped on devilled turkey and the wine of the
district, Tierno and Malaga; after which we turned
into bed, warning the waiter to summon us early, and
have a guide to lead us toward the neighbouring hills,
where we intended to make some havock among the
game next day.
</p>

<p>
Punctually at five o'clock in the morning the mozo-de-cafe
roused us, and, after coffee, we shouldered our
double-barrelled rifles, and accompanied by a young
'gamin' named Pedrillo, for whose fidelity the
waiter pledged his "honour," we departed on our
ramble.
</p>

<p>
If ever you saw the Spanish beggar-boys, as
depicted by Murillo in his famous picture, which is
now in Dulwich College, they will know perfectly the
aspect of Pedrillo, our little guide.
</p>

<p>
He was about twelve years old; but, hardened by
indigence and sharpened by privation, his perceptive
faculties were keener than those of many a man.  His
sallow little visage was stamped with more of the
animal than the intellectual being; his eyes were
black, glossy, and glittered alternately with cunning
and intelligence.  His sole attire consisted of a
dilapidated shirt, a pair of knee-breeches, and a cowl,
which confined his luxuriant black hair; he had zinc
rings in his ears, and bore altogether the aspect of a
little Lazzarone.
</p>

<p>
He was intelligent withal, and he told us a vast
number of anecdotes, which increased in wonder and
ferocity as we paid him one peseta after another; but
he dwelt particularly on the achievements of a certain
Juan Roa, otherwise styled de Antequera, who was
then prowling in that savage range of mountains, from
whence he descended sometimes alone, sometimes
with many followers, especially when the Solano blew
from Africa, to commit outrages among the quiet
quintas and villages of the fertile Vega, where he was
said to be in league with every posada-keeper for forty
miles around Malaga.
</p>

<p>
About mid-day we rested under the cool shadow of
a cork wood, about ten miles from the city; it was a
beautiful place, where the sward was soft as velvet,
and where a thick border of blushing rose-trees, and
wild hydrangias flourished near us.  Here we shared
our provisions with a paisano and two armed
contrabandistas whom we met, and who shared with us their
wine in return.  The two smugglers had strong and
active horses, and carried blunderbusses and pistols to
guard their bales of chocolate, soap, tobacco, and
cigars; they were fine, merry fellows, gaudily dressed,
and full of fun and anecdote; for in Spain the
contrabandista is a species of travelling newspaper.  Now
all their news were of the last feat or outrage of Juan
Roa.
</p>

<p>
"I would give a guinea to meet this interesting
vagabond; the interview would tell famously in
some of the monthlies," said Hall, with a heedless
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I think I should know him," said I; "for we saw
at least twenty coloured prints of him in the shops on
the Alameda, last night.  He is a ferocious-looking
dog!"
</p>

<p>
The contrabandistas looked round with alarm, and
then laughed immoderately.
</p>

<p>
"Ferocious?  Indeed, señor?" said the paisano;
"I beg to differ from you, having myself seen Juan
of Antequera face to face; and so think him quite
like other men."
</p>

<p>
I gazed at the speaker, whom, by his green velvet
jacket, adorned by four dozen of brass buttons, his
sombrero, with its broad yellow ribband, his black
plush breeches, red scarf and shoe-buckles, I
supposed to be the substantial farmer of one of the
adjacent quintas.  He had a fine dark face, a powerful
figure, and two black eyes that seemed to be always
looking through me.  Over one eyebrow, he had a
large black patch.  He carried a riding switch, had a
knife in his girdle; and altogether, as he lolled on
the sward, smoking a paper cigar and sipping red
wine, I thought he would make a fine and striking
sketch, and equal to any by Pinelli.
</p>

<p>
"Juan Roa," said he, "has committed great
outrages in the Vega of Granada.  The Duke of
Wellington has there an estate, having on it about three
hundred tenants, who yield some fifteen thousand
dollars of rental; but Juan has thrice drawn every
duro of it from the old abagado, who acts as steward
to the duke."
</p>

<p>
The contrabandistas again laughed at this immoderately.
</p>

<p>
"You have seen this Juan of Antequera, have you
not?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Face to face&mdash;often, señor."
</p>

<p>
"And so have I," said little Pedrillo.
</p>

<p>
"You! and when was this, my little fellow?" said
Jack Hall.
</p>

<p>
"On the night old Barradas, the muleteer, was
murdered."
</p>

<p>
The Spaniard with the patch knit his brows.
</p>

<p>
"Caramba!" said he; "ah! I remember that."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us about this murder," said Hall.
</p>

<p>
"You must know, señors," said Pedrillo, "that at
the foot of the Sierra de Mija, about five miles from
this, there stands a wayside inn, called La Posada
del Cavallo, for the keeper, Martin Secco, had a great
horse painted on his signboard.  This man is the
uncle of Juan Roa, or of Antequera.  He has a
wife, and had two daughters.  The place is lonely;
and it often happens, that those who put up there for
the night forget the right path; for they are lost
among the mountains, or fall into the sand-pits&mdash;at
least, they are seldom heard of after.  You
understand, señors?"
</p>

<p>
The Spaniard with the patch smiled grimly, and
played with his knife.
</p>

<p>
"One night last year, I guided Pedro Barradas, the
Cordovan muleteer, to the posada, when it was dark
as pitch.  Pedro was very old, and half blind, and
had never been that way before.  A storm came on,
and he desired me to remain with him, saying he
would pay me well; old Barradas was rich; he had
made money in the war of independence, and in the
last civil war between the Carlists and Christines;
and had given three silver images to the church of
his native puebla in Jaen.
</p>

<p>
"We supped on baccallao, raisins, and plain bread,
for the season was Lent.  While we were at supper,
in the common hall of the posada, I heard the rain
pattering on the wooden shutters (there is not a glass
window in the house); I heard the thunder grumbling
among the hills, and the wind howling as it swept
over the fields and vineyards of the Vega.  It was a
lonely place for a poor boy who had neither father
nor mother, señors; but, then, I was not worth
killing, though many fears flitted through my mind; for
Martin's wife&mdash;an ugly and wicked-looking Basque
provincial&mdash;put some very alarming questions to old
Pedro Barradas.  She told him that the neighbourhood
was infested by bandidos and contrabandistas;
and asked if he was a heavy sleeper.
</p>

<p>
"'No,' said Barradas, 'in the war against Joseph
Buonaparte I learned the art of sleeping lightly.'
</p>

<p>
"'But what will you do if attacked?'
</p>

<p>
"'That is as may be; but I have only twenty
duros, and so shall sleep soundly enough.'
</p>

<p>
"These questions alarmed me very much; visions
of murder and slaughter came before me.  I crept close
to Barradas, who, as I have said, was very old and
very frail; but his presence seemed a protection to
me for a time.
</p>

<p>
"When the hour for bed arrived, we, who were the
only guests, were somewhat imperatively requested to
retire to our rooms by the wife of Martin Secco.
</p>

<p>
"Barradas saw, perhaps, his danger, and said that
I should sleep in the same room with him.
</p>

<p>
"But Inez Secco told him roughly that he must be
content to sleep alone.  Then the poor old man was
half-led and half-dragged away.  As for me, I was but
a boy; so they thrust me into a dark closet, where
some straw lay on the floor, and, desiring me to sleep
there and be thankful, left me.
</p>

<p>
"I lay down on the straw, and finding it wet, arose
in horror, fearing that it was blood; and so I
remained in the dark, praying to our Lady of the Seven
Sorrows, and trembling and listening to the howling
of the storm for more than an hour, when all the
other sounds in that terrible posada died away.
</p>

<p>
"I was just beginning to dose when a ray of light
streamed through the keyhole of my door; I heard it
opened, and lo!  Martin's wife, Inez Secco, appeared
with a long and sharp cuchillo in her hand.  A man
accompanied her.  He was Juan Roa de Antequera!
Terror paralysed me; and she believed me to be
asleep, for she felt all over my clothes&mdash;that is, my
poor shirt and breeches-pockets, from which she
took two quarter-duros&mdash;all I possessed in this world;
and then, passing the light thrice across my face, to
assure herself that I slept, the hag went away
muttering&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Caramba! only a half-duro; this little wretch is
neither worth lodging nor killing.'
</p>

<p>
"Immediately after this I heard them whispering
with Martin Secco; and then they knocked at the
door of old Pedro Barradas, who, like a cautious man,
had fastened it on the inside.
</p>

<p>
"'Get up,' said they, 'Señor Barradas&mdash;get up&mdash;you
are wanted.'
</p>

<p>
"But old Barradas either slept like a top, or he was
too wary to open; for he heeded them not.
</p>

<p>
"Then I heard Juan and Martin muttering curses
as they deliberately forced open the door; next there
came a terrible cry of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Help!  Pedrillo, help!  Ayuda, por amor de
neustra Señora Santissima!'
</p>

<p>
"This was followed by sounds like those made by
a sheep when the knife of the carnicero is in its
throat; and, in the meantime, Martin's two daughters
were singing as loud as they could, and dancing a
bolero in the passage, to conceal these terrible sounds,
which froze the blood within me."
</p>

<p>
Here Pedrillo paused.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Jack Hall, impatiently; "and how
did you escape?"
</p>

<p>
"If the noble señors would help me to refresh my
memory&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I comprehend," said I, tossing a peseta to
him; "now fire away, Pedrillo."
</p>

<p>
"You should not encourage this young picaro,
Señor Caballero," said the Spaniard, whose face was
now darkened by a terrible frown; "for it is my
belief that he was the mere decoy, who led poor old
Pedro Barradas to that villanous posada."
</p>

<p>
Instead of being angry, Pedrillo lifted up his
hands, and prayed that Heaven and our Lady of the
Seven Sorrows would forgive the speaker for his vile
suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"I never closed an eye that night.  In the morning
I was told by Inez the Patrona, that old Barradas had
departed across the hills of Antequera without me.
Martin Secco asked me how I had slept?  I said,
like a dormouse; and as soon as I was free, I ran
like a hare back to Malaga; and to make up for the
loss of my last night's rest, slept like a torpedo under
the trees of the Alameda."
</p>

<p>
"You acquainted the magistrates&mdash;the alguazils,
of course," said Hall, knocking the ashes from his
third cigar.
</p>

<p>
"I was only a poor, ragged, little picaro,"
replied Pedrillo, in a whining voice; "and who would
believe me?  Besides, old Barradas was a stranger
from Cordova or Jaen; and a man, more or less, is
nothing in Granada; but since that time Martin's two
daughters have been sent to the galleys at Barcelona,
by the captain-general of the kingdom, for intriguing
in many ways with the contrabandistas of Jaen.
Now, señors, the noon is past; and if it please you,
't is time we were moving, if you wish to reach the
Sierra."
</p>

<p>
While we were placing fresh caps on our rifles,
and preparing to start, the Spaniard with the patch,
who had listened to Pedrillo's story with great
impatience, now seized that young gamin by the arm,
and grasping it like a vice, gave him a savage scowl,
and said something in Spanish; but so rapidly, that
I could only make out that he was reprehending him
severely for telling us "a succession of falsehoods."
</p>

<p>
So I thought at that time; afterwards I was
enabled to put a different construction upon his
indignation, at which Pedrillo seemed to be
considerably alarmed.
</p>

<p>
Bidding adieu to him and the contrabandistas, we
departed under Pedrillo's guidance, and (sans leave)
shot all along the sides of the mountain range, on
the slope of which stands the small but ancient city
of Antequera, so noted for the revolt of the Moors in
the sixteenth century; and had some narrow escapes
from falling into those remarkable pits, where the
water settles in the low places, and is formed into
salt by the mere heat of the sun.
</p>

<p>
We did not see much game, but knocked over
a few brace of birds, and with these, and two red
foxes, our little guide Pedrillo was quite laden.  So
he seemed to think; for, taking advantage of the
concealment afforded him by some olive groves, and
the scattered remnants of an abandoned vineyard,
among which we had become entangled, the young
rogue slipped away with our game and made off,
either towards Malaga or Antequera; at least we saw
no more of him, or of his burden at that time.
</p>

<p>
This was just about the close of the day, when
Hall and I were draining the last drop of our flask,
and surveying from the mountain slope the magnificent
prospect of the verdant Vega, spreading at our
feet like a brightly-tinted map, having that warm and
roseate glow, which well might win it the name of
Tierra Caliente.  Malaga, the ancient bulwark of
Spain against Africa, was shining in the distance,
with its towers and gates, its flat-roofed houses, and
vast cathedral; its Moorish castles and gothic spires,
all bathed in a warm and sunny yellow; while beyond
lay the broad blue Mediterranean, dotted by sails,
and changing from gold to purple and to blue.
</p>

<p>
This was all very fine: but our pleasure was
lessened by the conviction that our little rascal
Pedrillo was absconding with our game; and we
knew that it would never do to relate to the gun-room
mess how we had been outwitted, on returning to the
Blonde next day.
</p>

<p>
The foreground of this beautiful panorama was
broken by innumerable small hillocks and clumps of
wood of many kinds; but principally olive, pine, and
cork trees, that grew on the slope of the great
Sierra; and though the sky and landscape darkened
fast after the sun set, we instituted a strict and angry
search for Pedrillo, shouting and whistling as we
stumbled on, we knew not very well whither, looking
for our lost spoils&mdash;two foxes, with gallant brushes,
and eight brace of birds.
</p>

<p>
No moon had risen: the wind began to whistle
among the groves and hollows; the night was very
dark.
</p>

<p>
"What, if we should meet Master Juan of Antequera?"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"If he had our game, I should be very well
pleased," replied Hall; "but I wish that Pedrillo
had been with old Scratch when we hired him
yesterday.  If I had the little lubber on board the
Blonde, I would show him the maintop."
</p>

<p>
"Spain is a land of mishaps and events," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday we were wishing for an adventure."
</p>

<p>
"And to-night we have one with a vengeance!"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"Belay; I see some one moving in that hollow.
Let us jump down&mdash;ahoy below there!"
</p>

<p>
"But we may lose the track," I urged.
</p>

<p>
"True; so do you remain where you are, while I
go down into the hollow.  Hollo now and then, to let
me know your whereabouts."
</p>

<p>
With his rifle in his hand, Hall, who was a fine
active fellow, sprang down into a ravine that
suddenly yawned before us, and I remained with my
rifle cocked, and stooped low to watch what might
follow.  Hall disappeared in the obscurity below.  I
halloed; but the night wind tossed back my own
shout upon me.  Then I thought I heard his voice,
and sprang after him; but fell upon a point of rock,
and sank, completely stunned, to the earth.
</p>

<p>
There I lay for nearly a quarter of an hour, unable
to move, or rally my senses.  When I arose, I found
myself at the bottom of the hollow, and upon a
narrow mule track; the moon was rising brightly at
the south end of the ravine, silvering the masses of
rocks, tufts of laurel-trees, and wild vines that grew
in the clefts of the basalt.  I shouted, but received
no reply; and after a long and fruitless search could
discover no trace of Hall in any direction.
</p>

<p>
Considerably alarmed for his safety as well as my
own&mdash;for to lie at night upon those hills of Antequera,
with the devilish stories of Pedrillo and the
contrabandistas haunting one's memory, was anything but
pleasant&mdash;I tried the charges of my rifle, looked again
to the percussion-caps, and set off in that direction
where, by the rising of the moon, I knew that Malaga
must lie; but frequently paused to hollo for Jack
Hall, and received no reply save the echoes of the
rocks.
</p>

<p>
The ravine descended and grew more open.  Again
I saw the Vega sleeping at my feet in the haze; and,
on turning an angle of the road, found myself close
to an inn or taberna, which I approached with joy,
concluding that my friend Jack must have gone that
way, and would probably be there.
</p>

<p>
Like all Spanish inns, it was a large and mis-shapen
edifice, the lower story of which was nothing better
than a great open shed, for mules and vehicles; and,
ascending from thence by a stair, I reached a gallery,
at the door of which I was received by the host, who
carried in his hand a stable lantern.
</p>

<p>
"Entrar," said he, bowing profoundly; "entrar,
señor."
</p>

<p>
"I have been shooting on the mountains," said I,
"and have lost my companion, a British naval officer.
Has he passed this way?"
</p>

<p>
"No, señor," replied the host, (whose face I could
not yet see,) as he led me up another stair.
</p>

<p>
"Then get supper prepared; for he must soon be
here, as I have no doubt he knows pretty well the
direction of Malaga.  And now," said I, drawing a
long breath, as I seated myself, "what place is this?"
</p>

<p>
"La Posada del Cavallo." (!)
</p>

<p>
"Eh! ah&mdash;and you?" I asked, in a thick voice.
</p>

<p>
"Martin Secco, at your service, Señor Caballero!"
</p>

<p>
"Here was a dénouement!
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens!" thought I, mechanically resuming
my rifle; "if the stories of Pedrillo should be
true."
</p>

<p>
I scrutinised my host and hostess.
</p>

<p>
Martin had a broad and open visage, with keen eyes,
and a black beard as thick as a horse-brush; a wide
mouth, that frequently expanded in grins; but in those
grins no radiance ever lit up his glassy eyes.  The
mouth laughed; but they remained immovable&mdash;invariably
a bad sign.  His forehead receded, and his
ears were placed high upon his head.  At the first
glance, I concluded that my señor patron was an
unmitigated brute.  His figure was somewhat portly,
and encased in a brown jacket, brown knee-breeches,
and black stockings; he wore his hair confined in a
caul, and had a yellow sash round his waist.
</p>

<p>
His wife was, as Pedrillo had described Inez Secco,
a Basque, for her Spanish was almost unintelligible;
and her coarse black hair was plaited in one thick tail,
which reached to her heels.  Her gown was of rough
red cloth, with tight sleeves and a short skirt,
displaying a pair of yellow worsted stockings and leather
sandals, fastened by thongs above the ancle.  Her face
was coarse and bloated; but the expression of her eye
was terrible.  It hovered between the bright ferocious
glare of a snake, and the glazed orb of an arrant sot.
She scanned me closely; and I thought the old devil
(she was a Spanish woman, and past forty,) was
accurately appraising the value of all I had on.
</p>

<p>
"Well, señora patrona," said I, "what can I have
for supper?"
</p>

<p>
"The señor has come at a bad time, for we have
little or no provisions in our larder."  (The larder of
every Spanish inn has been in the same condition
since the days of Cervantes and Gongora.)  "For
now this road between Malaga and Antequera is but
little frequented after noon-day, owing to the terrible
robberies and the four assassinations committed by
Juan Roa, during the last Solano.  Caramba! 't is
very hard that we should suffer for him."
</p>

<p>
"What can I have, then?"
</p>

<p>
"A roasted galina, dressed with a few beans," said
the patrona.
</p>

<p>
"And a glass of good aquadiente," added the host;
"our Tierno has soured in the wine-skins."
</p>

<p>
"'T is poor fare this, for hungry men.  I have said
that I expect my friend's arrival momently."
</p>

<p>
The host gave a cold smile, and said, "We have
had nothing ourselves, for a week past, but Indian
corn and boiled garbanzos (beans); but the best we
have is at the disposal of the señor caballero."
</p>

<p>
The inn was old and crazy; the wind came in at
one cranny, and whistled out by another.  The roof,
walls, and floor of the large apartment in which we
three were seated, consisted of a multitude of beams
and boards, placed horizontally and diagonally,
without skill and without regard to design or appearance.
There was but one candle in the house (as the host
assured me), and it was rapidly guttering down in the
currents of air.  The patrona transferred it from the
lantern to an iron holder, and it was placed on the
table to light the room and my supper.
</p>

<p>
An ostler, or nondescript servant, wearing fustian
knee-breeches, without braces, with a muleteer's
embroidered shirt, and having a yellow handkerchief
tied round his head, spread a (not over-clean) cloth on
the table; knives, forks, and covers were laid for two,
with a cold fowl, a loaf of white bread, a dish of
beans, garlic, and a bottle of aquadiente.
</p>

<p>
I observed this wild-looking waiter frequently
glancing at my rifle, and the jewelled dirk that dangled
at my waist-belt; I became suspicious of everything.
</p>

<p>
"You are well armed, señor," said he.
</p>

<p>
"It is natural; for arms are my profession," said I.
</p>

<p>
I looked at my watch: the hands indicated eleven
o'clock!  Two hours had elapsed since Hall and I
had separated; still there was no appearance of him.
Twenty times I opened the shutters of the unglazed
windows, and listened intently; but the night wind
that swept down the dark ravine in the Sierra, brought
neither shout nor footstep; so I resolved to sup, go
to bed, and trust to daylight for discovering Jack, if
he did not arrive at the posada before morning.
</p>

<p>
I had just concluded supper, when the last remains
of the last candle in this solitary inn, sank into its
iron socket, and left us in darkness; at least with no
other light than the red wavering glow that came
from the hearth, where a few roots of pine and
corkwood smouldered beside the brown puchero, in which
the amiable patrona had boiled the beans for my repast.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a pretty piece of business!" said Martin
Secco; "we have not another candle were it to light
a blessed altar; and the señor Caballero must go to
bed in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Heed not that, señor patron," said I; "for I am
a soldier, as you may see, and am used to discomfort."
</p>

<p>
"'T is well; for I am sure that the señor has
experienced nothing but discomfort in our poor posada.
When I am rich enough, señor, I hope to have an
hotel in the Alameda; and then should the Caballero
ever come to Malaga again, he will remember Martin
Secco."
</p>

<p>
At this remark, I heard the patrona utter a low
chuckling laugh; but whether at the prospect of the
fine hotel, or the doubtful chances of my ever again
visiting Malaga, I could not say.
</p>

<p>
"Now, señor patron," said I, rising and taking up
my rifle, "I should like to reach the town betimes
to-morrow; so show me to my chamber, and should my
friend arrive, fail not to call me."
</p>

<p>
"Will you not leave your gun here?" suggested
the host.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you&mdash;no," said I, while my undefined
suspicions grew stronger within me.  "Do you lead
the way, señor, and I shall follow.  Good night,
señora patrona."
</p>

<p>
"Bueno noche, señor," said she, stirring up the
embers; and we separated.
</p>

<p>
To follow Martin was perhaps the most unpleasant
part that I had yet acted; for I had to grope my way
after him along a dark passage, about forty feet long,
at the end of which he ushered me into a room,
where there was no other light than that given by the
moon, which shone through a small window glazed
with little panes of coarse glass.  Here he bade me
"Bueno noche;" and, after many apologies for my
miserable accommodation, left me.
</p>

<p>
The apartment was small.  In one corner stood a
French bed, having light-coloured curtains; this, with
a basin-stand, two chairs and a mirror, made up the
furniture.  Like a true soldier, I turned to secure the
door.
</p>

<p>
Destitute of lock or bolt: it had only a small
thumb-latch!
</p>

<p>
Dismounting the ewer and basin, I placed the stand
end-wise between the bed and the door, firmly fixing
it, and thus forming a barricade, which none could
force without awaking me.  To make all sure, I again
dropped the ramrod into each barrel of my rifle,
passed a finger over the caps, unbuckled the belt at
which my dirk dangled; and, without undressing, for
every moment I expected to hear Jack Hall hallooing
outside the house; in short, to be prepared for
anything, I threw myself down on the coverlet, and
weary and worn by a long day's ramble among the
mountains, prepared to sleep.
</p>

<p>
For a long time a species of painful wakefulness
possessed me; the moans of the passing wind, the
flapping of a loose board in the external gallery, the
wavering shadows thrown by the moonlight on the
damp and discoloured walls; even the ticking of my
watch disturbed me, and kept me constantly thinking
of poor Hall's unaccountable absence, with many a
fear that he might have fallen into the hands of Juan
of Antequera, and not a few reproaches for my having
perhaps too easily relinquished my search for him.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts completely obliterated any sense of
my own immediate danger; but I was about to drop
asleep when something moist that oozed over my
neck and face aroused me.  I started, fully awake in
a moment; and, passing a hand across my cheek,
looked at it in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"Blood!" said I, springing off the bed, while a
thrill ran through me.  I had not been wounded or
cut by my fall; then from whence came this terrible
moisture?  I examined the pillow, and found the
lower part of it quite wet; I turned it, and lo! it was
saturated with blood!
</p>

<p>
This was the reason, that Martin Secco had
declined to give me a candle.  My heart beat thick and
fast; apprehension of something horrible came over
me, and I remembered the stories of Pedrillo.  I
also recollected that I had some excellent Spanish
cigar fusees, and tearing three or four blank leaves
from my note book, I twisted them together, lit them,
and surveyed the dingy chamber.  The boards in
front of the bed were marked by recent spots of
blood; I raised the little fringe or curtain, and,
guided by some terrible instinct, looked below, and
saw&mdash;what?
</p>

<p>
Poor Jack Hall lying there in his naval uniform,
with his epaulette torn off, and his throat literally
cut from ear to ear!
</p>

<p>
He had found his way here before me, and been
assassinated.
</p>

<p>
Almost paralysed, I continued for half a minute to
gaze at this terrible spectacle, till the paper burned
down to my fingers and expired.  I heard my heart
beating; and my head spun round as I tightened my
belt and grasped my loaded rifle.  Before I could
adopt any plan of operations, I heard a rustling and
whispering in the passage near my door; and, looking
through a crack in the panels, saw, within a yard
of me, Martin Secco, bearing in one hand the rifle of
my poor friend, and in the other a lighted candle,
although he had made to me so many apologies,
about two hours before, for not having another in the
house.  As he approached, he handed it to a boy, in
whom I discovered Pedrillo; and then the light
flashed upon two other men, in one of whom I recognised
the ostler, and in the other, our acquaintance
of the noon, with the patch on his face, and wearing
the green velvet jacket and sombrero.  This worthy
had a pistol in one hand and a knife in the other.
The patrona was also there, with her wolfish eyes
and enormous Basque queue.
</p>

<p>
Outrage and assassination were impressed on the
hard lines of all their cruel and savage visages; and
I perceived at once that without a vigorous effort I
was lost&mdash;that my life was forfeited; and all the
anticipations of newspaper paragraphs; "a mysterious
disappearance" in the "Times" and "Military Gazette,"
flashed upon my mind.  I had youth, a noble
profession, many kind friends, my regiment, and
home, with "the best of expectations," as old
dowagers say, on one hand; a horrible and sudden death&mdash;a
lonely scene of unknown butchery, on the other!
</p>

<p>
I cocked the locks of my rifle, and resolutely
removed the barricade from the door.
</p>

<p>
"Take time, Juan Roa," said the patrona.
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongue, old perra; I know well enough
what I am doing," growled the personage in green,
whom I now knew to be that terrible outlaw, who
since the Carlist war, had laughed at the carabineros
and alguazils, and kept all Malaga, the Sierra de
Mija, and the Vega of Granada astir and in
terror.
</p>

<p>
Including the patrona, and the treacherous young
rascal Pedrillo, I had five desperate enemies, and only
two bullets at their service.
</p>

<p>
"Let us prove whether the Inglese is asleep, before
we enter," said the patron, knocking at the door
gently, and placing the candle behind him.
</p>

<p>
"No answer&mdash;he is certainly asleep," whispered
the patrona.
</p>

<p>
"Knock again," growled Juan Roa.
</p>

<p>
A smart blow was then given; but still I made no
reply.  Then the patron applied his hand to the
latch; but before he could open the door, I fired
right through the slender panels, and shot him dead
by one bullet, knocking over the ostler by the other,
which he received through his neck and shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Clubbing my rifle, I then rushed out; and charging
them in the smoke and confusion, dealt Juan Roa a
tremendous blow with the butt end, which levelled
him beside the two ruffians who lay bleeding in the
narrow passage.  Escaping a pistol shot from Juan,
but receiving two desperate cuts from the termagant
patrona and the wasp Pedrillo, I reached the end of
the passage, sprang through the common hall, and
found the outer door fastened.  By main strength I
tore it open, and reached the external gallery, over
which I dropped, though it was fully twelve feet from
the ground; and, just as I did so, the boy Pedrillo
fired one of Juan's pistols after me; but I escaped
it, and ran down the mountain slope, loading my
rifle as I went, and driving a bullet home into each
barrel.
</p>

<p>
Grey morning was spreading along the east, and
the red flush of the coming sun was brightening
behind the dark towers of Gibral-Faro, and sparkling
on the lattices of Malaga.  The aromatic plants were
putting forth their sweetest perfume, and the light
foliage of the sugar-cane, the cotton plant, and the
citron tree, were shaking off the heavy dews of night.
The air was clear and cool; after the toils of the
past day, the sleepless night and its terrors, the
fresh dewy atmosphere revived me, and, dashing down
the lonely mountain-side, I reached a little puebla,
and reported the whole affair to the officer who there
commanded a party of the carabineros of Antequera.
</p>

<p>
A sergeant and twenty troopers galloped away to
the posada, which they found completely deserted by
all its living tenants; but they hung the body of the
patron upon a tree, burned the house to the ground,
and conveyed the mangled remains of poor Jack Hall
to Malaga, where they were interred next day, with
all the honours of war, in that corner of the Campo
Santo which is appropriated for the burial of
strangers; and there the marines of the Blonde fired
three volleys over the grave, where as noble a heart
as Her Majesty's service possessed was committed to
the earth of Spain.
</p>

<p>
An hour's examination before a magistrate, who
swore me across my sword as to the particulars, was
all the judicial inquiry ever made; we sailed next day,
and reached Portsmouth, after a fine run, and without
any other mishaps; but I shall never forget that
terrible night among the mountains of Antequera,
Martin Secco, his wife's tail, and the horrors of La
Posada del Cavallo.
</p>

<p>
Jack's adventure elicited a burst of applause, and
was voted the story of the evening, notwithstanding
the great spice of the miraculous and holy, which
had seasoned the narrative of the Major Don Joaquim.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
THE HALT IN A CORK WOOD
</h3>

<p>
Next morning betimes we left the venta of Castellar
where, overnight, we had spent so many pleasant
hours.  The Major Don Joaquim was very curious to
know the object of our mission to Seville, of which
he announced himself a well-known citizen; but we
declined to state the reason of our visit in uniform
to that far-famed city; neither did we mention that
our business lay with no less a personage than the
captain-general of Los Cuatros Reinos.
</p>

<p>
In a country like Spain, where the people are so
jealous of their national honour and so revengeful,
we did not conceive that it would be conducive to our
safety to state that we were the identical officers
whose affair with the guarda costa had caused so
much heartburning for some weeks past, and so much
correspondence between our governor and the
minister Espartero; so, somewhat piqued by our
reserve, the major gave us a formal bow, and clambered
into the vehicle which was to convey him to Medina.
We separated, the convoy of calessos got into motion
after much noise and vociferation on the part of the
drivers, the stable-boys, the hostalero, and the
passengers, who were all gabbling at once in full-toned
Spanish as they rolled away under the escort of a
party of very ill-appointed dragoons in the service of
Donna Isabella la Catolica, while we rode off in the
opposite direction towards Alcala de los Gazules, a
small town, which lies on the Seville road, and through
which we passed soon after.
</p>

<p>
"Let us push on," said I, to interrupt Jack, who
had been rallying me pretty smartly about Donna
Paulina, and vowing that all this affair of a trip to
Seville had been foreseen and preconcerted by me for
the purpose of meeting her again and continuing a
flirtation which was a source of great merriment to
the regiment.  "Let us push on, Jack, for I feel very
anxious&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To reach Seville, of course; but it won't run
away; we shall find it in its proper place on the left
bank of the Guadalquiver."
</p>

<p>
"You mistake me.  I was thinking how awkward
it would be for us if the Himalaya was to come round
during our absence; and if on our return we should
find the whole regiment embarked and steaming
away for the Crimea."
</p>

<p>
"Awkward!  I should think so, rather; but it is not
likely they can decamp in such a hurry.  After all
we heard last night about the restless habits of the
good people in these mountains, and their vague or
peculiar ideas regarding property, together with the
eccentricities of this Don Fabrique, do we not run a
little risk in proceeding without an escort?"
</p>

<p>
"There is risk, certainly; but our return is not to
be thought of till the duty is done."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not&mdash;what would the regiment say?"
</p>

<p>
"And what should we think of ourselves?"
</p>

<p>
"We are, I hope, a match for any six Spaniards,
with our swords and revolvers, in fighting; and with
these good nags under us I should think we are more
than a match for them in flying.  But the noon is
becoming so hot that I propose we should halt under
that grove of cork-trees and there take a siesta."
</p>

<p>
We halted accordingly at the base of a steep
mountain chain, between the cleft peaks of which a
noonday-flood of yellow light was gushing.  Sterile,
abrupt, and bare above us rose the ridgy rocks: the
little valley at the base was teeming with verdure and
fertility, but it was silent and solitary, for not a sound
was heard save the murmur of a stream which bubbled
from a fissure in a vine-covered cliff.  It
meandered between meadows of aromatic plants, and
sought deep pools over which the oleander and the
bay threw their branches, and the cool shady thickets
of the dark wood of olive and cork-trees.
</p>

<p>
Just where we dismounted, we found a personage
lounging on the grass.  He was smoking a cigar, and
had a long gun beside him.  Without rising for a
minute nearly, he scrutinised us and our horses with
marked curiosity.  His costume was somewhat gay,
being in the highest style of the bull-ring, or that of
a majo or dandified Spanish ladrone, whose free
aspect and gallant air make him the admiration of the
dark-eyed paisanas and the envy of their more
peaceful male relatives; for the majo is the bravo of
our own time.
</p>

<p>
This personage wore an ample brown cloak, which
hung loosely about his shoulders, a black velvet
sombrero, with a large tuft of black plush on one side
thereof, and under its deep rim his coal-black hair
fell in heavy locks, and his flashing eyes watched all
our motions, with an indescribable expression of
stealth and suspicion.  A long knife and a pair of
brass-butted pistols were in his gaudy sash; he wore
leathern gaiters, and was playing with the blade of a
navaja, or clasp-knife, about ten inches long&mdash;a deadly
instrument, which the Spaniard is never without, for
therewith he cuts his 'carne' and bread, or his
bacallao in Lent, slices his melon in summer, and slashes
the face of any person with whom he may chance to
differ in opinion.  Indeed, the visage of this lounger
bore the very unmistakable mark of a long slash
which had once laid it open from eye to chin.
Beside him stood a beautiful Andalusian jennet, high
of head, and bold in chest; its gaily-fringed bridle
was thrown over the branch of an olive tree, and
it was accoutred with a high-peaked saddle of antique
form, covered by a piece of white sheepskin, which
was spread also over a pair of holsters.
</p>

<p>
"Buenos dias, señor," said I; "a good morning&mdash;I
fear we are disturbing you."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, señores&mdash;the greensward, the shadow
of those trees, and the waters of this stream, flowing
from yonder sierra, belong to us all in common.  Sit
down, señores, and halter your horses, as you see I
have haltered mine.  You belong to the Gibraltar
garrison, I presume&mdash;right&mdash;you are Inglesos."
</p>

<p>
"No, Brittanicos," said I, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"And whither go ye?"
</p>

<p>
"To Seville."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, would I were going with you: it is a place of
joy and merriment, Seville.  The sun shines on it once
every day of the year; yet I go there but seldom.
Allow me to make you each a cigarillo."
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure."
</p>

<p>
To have declined would have been an affront as
great as to refuse a proffered snuff-mull in the
country of the clans.  Our Spaniard produced one of
those little books of soft blank paper (almost the only
volumes used in Spain), and tore out three leaves; he
then took tobacco from his silk pouch and made up
three little cigars very neatly and adroitly; but twice
during the operation I detected his stealthy eyes
scanning us from under his bushy eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
My little box of patent lights excited his wonder
and admiration, as he was about to exert his patience
by having recourse to the antiquated flint and steel.
Then Jack Slingsby produced his travelling flask; I
brought forth mine, and the Spaniard had a capacious
bota of wine, a drinking cup of leather, a piece of
bacallao and biscuits; and we were just proceeding
to lunch, when his Andalusian jennet pricked up its
ears and neighed uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Maldito!" said our companion, as a scowl came
over his visage and his hand fell mechanically on the
lock of his gun; "some one approaches."
</p>

<p>
"An old woman on a donkey, and nothing more,"
said Slingsby, carelessly; "amigo mio, you look as
much alarmed as if you expected the terrible
Fabrique de Urquija, or Juan Roa of Antequera."
</p>

<p>
The keen eyes of the Spaniard flashed, and he
looked at Jack as if he would have pierced him
through.
</p>

<p>
"I fear neither Don Fabrique nor any other man,"
said he gruffly; "a woman on a burro&mdash;oh&mdash;it must
be poor Sister Santa Veronica, of Estrelo, a town
about a league distant."
</p>

<p>
"How is she named so?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"After the blessed Santa Veronica who wiped the
pale face of our Lord, when dying upon his cross,"
replied the Spaniard, lowering his head; "and as she
did so, on her kerchief there became impressed the
most wondrous of religious miracles&mdash;the Santa
Faz&mdash;the holy countenance of Jaen, where it is still
preserved in our cathedral, and from which the portraits
of our Saviour are all taken; hence it is that his sad
and upturned face, with its crown of bloody thorns
and curling heard, and the long yellow hair parted
over the smooth pale brow, are so well known over
all the Christian world."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, an elderly woman, habited like a nun,
in a coarse and well-patched dress of black serge,
with a hood of spotless white linen folded across her
brow and chin, and having its long ends drooping
lappetwise down her withered cheeks, rode up to us
on a donkey, which displayed&mdash;what one seldom sees
in a Spanish ass&mdash;evident signs of being ill-fed and
ill-groomed.  The nun, who had a careworn, grave, and,
though stern, not unpleasing expression of face,
carried a covered basket on her arm.  Our companion
sprang to his feet, and, doffing his sombrero, hastened
to meet her and to hold the bridle of her animal.
</p>

<p>
She was abroad, as she told us, begging alms and
food for the sisters of her convent&mdash;ten ladies&mdash;all of
whom were of noble rank, but the most of whose
kinsmen had fallen in battle under Don Ramon de
Cabrera, and thus left them friendless.  They were
now, by the confiscation of the ecclesiastical revenues,
and the seizure of those sums which they had paid
as a dowry into the convent treasury, reduced to
extreme penury in their old age, and were driven from
their pleasant convent in the beautiful vega of Jaen;
since then they had endeavoured to perform the duties
of their order, and to serve God, in a poor and
half-ruined house, which belonged to a noble, charitable.
and religious lady, Donna Dominga de Lucena, y
Colmenar de Orieja, at Estrelo; and now would not
the noble Caballeros give something to the poor
ladies of Santa Theresa, however small, for the love
of God and of blessed charity?
</p>

<p>
All this, which she prettily told, was addressed to
us, rather than to the stranger, at whom she glanced
uneasily from time to time, although he stood
bare-headed, with the deepest respect, and holding her
burro by the bridle.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance of the sisterhood being
befriended by the mother of Donna Paulina would
have sufficed to interest us, if the wrong done them
by the present Government of Spain had failed to do
so.  Our purses were at once produced, and we
respectfully raised our caps on presenting the poor nun
with a few pillared dollars, which no doubt she little
expected from two heretical Brittanicos.
</p>

<p>
They had been robbed of everything, she continued&mdash;at
least, all save their cases of reliques and
the bones of Santa Theresa, which they had borne on
their shoulders in sad procession from Jaen to
Estrelo; and, moreover, they had lost the wonderful
portrait of their patroness, which had been seized
and sold by those hijos de Luiz Philipe, the men of
the new administration; but it was no fault of the
present Queen of Spain, for poor Isabella la Catolica
had wept her eyes out in the cause of the poor monks
and nuns.  The señores had, no doubt, heard of the
wonderful portrait of the blessed Theresa?
</p>

<p>
In great sorrow we professed our ignorance thereof.
</p>

<p>
"Madre Mia!  It was said to be an Alonzo Cano,
and had narrowly escaped the clutches of the
Marshals Soult and Massena, when they swept away the
golden moidores of the Portuguese and the divine
Murillos of the Spaniards.  It belonged to the chapel
in which the saint was baptized, and was quite as
veritable and wonderful as the holy countenance of
Jaen, and was usually placed over the great altar;
but one day when the chapel was undergoing repair,
it was placed at the porch, where it was seen by a
certain ruined gamester&mdash;a savage and desperate
fellow, worse than Juan Roa or Don Fabrique, as he came
past that way.  In a fit of mad despair, having just
lost everything, he struck his dagger into the bosom
of the picture, from which there immediately gushed
out a torrent of blood in the sight of the terrified
people; while a faint cry was heard in the air, as of
one in pain afar off."
</p>

<p>
"And the gamester?"
</p>

<p>
"Went raving mad and died, chained like a wild
beast in the Gaza de Locos of Jaen."
</p>

<p>
To our gift, our companion added a doubloon, a
present so valuable that it excited our surprise and
kindled the fear of the poor nun, who accepted it with
reluctance, and, with abundance of genuflections
and thanks, whipped up her burro, which trotted
away.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I not have the honour of escorting you to
Estrelo, reverend señora?" cried our friend, hurrying
after her.
</p>

<p>
"Muchos gratias&mdash;no, no! a thousand thanks,
señor," she replied, hurriedly; "no one will molest a
poor sister of Santa Theresa."
</p>

<p>
Her ill-concealed repugnance to receive his alms
evidently impressed the Spaniard, who seated himself
in silence, and smoked with a sullen expression, as if
somewhat depressed by the whole affair; but Jack
Slingsby, who hated silence more than anything in the
world, began to make some casual inquiries as to
whether or not the famous Urquija had been heard of
hereabout, and where he was generally to be found.
</p>

<p>
"Found," reiterated the Spaniard, with a frown of
surprise; "he is often found by those who least like
such a discovery."
</p>

<p>
"So it seems," replied Jack, "and by the accounts
we heard of him at the&mdash;how do you name it?&mdash;the
venta last night, he seems to be ripe fruit for the
gallows."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said the Spaniard, quietly making up
another cigarillo, "you are very loud, Señor Viajador,
(traveller), in condemning this poor son of Andalusia,
this Don Fabrique; but you do so simply because
you know nothing about him; being, like most Englishmen,
totally ignorant of every country except your own
portion of Britain, and, believing that whatever is not
English must be radically, physically, and morally
wrong, you have come among us predisposed to
ridicule and to condemn."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce!" said Jack, with an air of pique; "I
beg to assure you, my fine fellow, that I could tell you
a story of a posada&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Enough, señor," replied the other, waving his hand
with great dignity of manner, while a savage gleam
shot over his stealthy eyes; "but allow me to inform
you that a bandit&mdash;I do not mean a pitiful picaro who
steals purses and pocket-handkerchiefs on the prado,
or a swindling raterillo who cheats at cards, but an
armed robber (and here his hand struck the butt of
his escopeta)&mdash;is a modern Spanish hero, and the
pretty paisana and the bluff muleteer sing of his
exploits in the same breath with those of Rodrigo de
Bivar, the Cid Campeador, Hernando de Cordova, and
the chiefs of the war of Independence, when we saw
the fields of Vimiero, of Talavera and Rorica; lend a
new lustre to the names of Mina, of Murillo, and of
Wellington!"
</p>

<p>
"Very likely; but this Don Fabrique commits such
devilish atrocities, and all that sort of thing," urged
Jack, closing with his incessant phrase.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know why poor Fabrique took his gun
and stiletto, and went to the mountains?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please."
</p>

<p>
"Listen.  There was an abogado, a lawyer of Jaen,
named Jacop el Escribano, who married the aunt of
Fabrique&mdash;an aunt who had been a mother to him
after his own died, or rather was murdered by the
Chapelgorri's.  She tended him, reared him, loved
and educated him at Alcala, and he was to be her
heir, for she was rich, and had mines of quicksilver
and cinnabar on the confines of Murcia; and her
heir he had every right to be, for other kindred she
had none.  Well, this good aunt fell sick; those who
were more than usually acute, or more than usually
evil-minded, said that the abogado had poisoned her
mentally and bodily.  At all events he wrote out her
will, which bequeathed all her property to himself,
whom failing, to a certain Gil Jacop, his son by a former
marriage, and to poor Fabrique, the son of her dead
brother, not a peseta, not a pistareen!  This limb of
Satan and the law, succeeding in all his ends and
objects, poisoned her ears against the poor student of
Alcala.  Well, the aunt died.  Full of sorrow Fabrique
hastened to his home to find the door of it shut in
his face, and the malicious abogado in possession of
everything, even to his aunt's snuff-box and armed
chair.  Our poor student rushed to the Alcalde, who
heard him with a smile of incredulity&mdash;why? because
he was the cousin of the abogado, and he, too, shut his
door in the face of Fabrique.  Bursting with indignation
he sought the corregidor, to pour out anew the
story of his wrongs; but, ay de mi! the corregidor, a
Commander of the Knights of Calatrava, was to dine
that day with the abogado, who had invited half the
city to feast, and weekly gave a magnificent tertulia in
the house of the dead woman.
</p>

<p>
"Fabrique lost all patience and, swore a dreadful
vow of vengeance, so the wise, just, and most illustrious
corregidor expelled him from the city, and by the alguazils
he was driven forth by the Audujar gate.  His last
money was in his pocket; so he bought a dagger and
musket, and shaking the dust off his feet at the puerta
de Audujar, he gathered together a band of gallant
spirits who had followed Juan Roa, and betook
himself to the mountains, leaving the abogado in
possession of his aunt's house and her mines upon the
Murcian frontier."
</p>

<p>
"And did he enjoy them long?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniard smiled grimly, and took a long quaff
of the bota.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to know, señor?'
</p>

<p>
"Exceedingly."
</p>

<p>
"Listen.  A week after these events our abogado
disappeared from Jaen, and no man knew whence he
had gone, and few cared.  A month after, a poor
wretch, half crazed and in rags, emaciated, pale and
hollow-cheeked by hunger, illness, agony, and
wandering, and whose vision had been destroyed by the
simple application of a red-hot ramrod, was found
near a village of the Sierra de Ronda.  It was Jacop
el Escribano&mdash;whose scribbling was at an end, and
whose eyes were closed on the world for ever."
</p>

<p>
"And his son, Gil Jacop?"
</p>

<p>
"Was found shot one fine morning at the corner
of that road, just where you see a rough wooden cross,
erected by the curate in memory of the affair, and to
beg a prayer of every passer-by for the dead man's
sinful soul.  The corregidor has thrice been robbed of
all he possessed&mdash;his rents, fees, and the revenue of
his commanderie; and the alcalde has quite as often
been beaten to the very verge of death.  Evil-disposed
people lay those things to the charge of Don
Fabrique; but I say nothing, having no opinion on
the subject."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are afraid of him?" said Jack, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Afraid&mdash;ha, ha!" said the Spaniard, taking up his
long gun; "no&mdash;not so much as you were afraid of
Juan Roa and Martin Secco, on that night in the
'Posada del Cavallo' at Malaga.
</p>

<p>
"How know you of that affair?" asked Jack,
starting to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Did I not hear it told at full length last night in
the venta at Castellar?"
</p>

<p>
"Were you there?" I inquired, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You saw a goatherd present&mdash;an old fellow with
a sheep-skin dress, a long beard, a crook, and bota."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"'T was I.  Last night I was a goatherd, because it
suited my purpose to appear so, and to laugh at the
terror of those miserable soap-boilers on hearing the
whistle of bullets in the Sierra; to-day I am
Fabrique de Urquija, the friend of poor Juan Roa; and
had you been less kind to that poor nun than you
were, it was my intention to have shot and robbed
you both, which I could easily have done, despite your
swords and revolvers, your English impudence and
cool assurance.  Vaya usted con Dios, and may you
have a pleasant ride to Seville; but attend more to
the rules of common politeness when next you speak
of Urquija beyond the security of your own lines at
Gibraltar.  I am not a bad fellow, señores, at times,
though more apt to take the advice of a curer of fish
than a curer of souls in Lent."
</p>

<p>
With these words he leaped on his horse, and
slinging his long gun by his right leg, galloped into
the cork wood, and disappeared.

CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE ALCALDE.
</h3>

<p>
This rencontre, by illustrating the danger of lingering
and of making chance acquaintance&mdash;dangers for
which no credit would be given by the Horse Guards,
and against which we found no hints afforded by our
"John Murray"&mdash;caused us to hasten through Estrelo
without paying a visit to the nuns of Santa Theresa,
which (on the base of our acquaintance with Sister
Veronica) we had proposed to do; and a ride of ten
miles further, through a fruitful and beautiful district,
brought us to the ancient ducal town of Medina
Sidonia, where the Spanish commandant invited us
to dinner, and where, finding ourselves in safe
quarters, we spent a pleasant evening, and with cigars
and Ciudad Real, Tresillo and Monte, whiled away the
hours until we retired to our posada, where we slept
undisturbed by rats or robbers, as quietly as if we
had been in the best hotel in London.
</p>

<p>
We crossed a stream next day, and arrived at Arcos
de la Frontierra, a picturesque little town, situated
upon a lofty rock, almost insulated by the Guadalete,
and so difficult of access on the south and west that
we had some trouble in discovering an entrance to it
anywhere.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of the place, with all its flat-roofed or
red-tiled houses clustering on the summit of a steep
and abrupt rock; its two large parish churches, with
the square campanile of Santa Maria, and the façade
of the palace of the reverend the vicar-general to the
metropolitan of Seville, all lit up by the flush of a
Spanish setting sun, and throwing a huge broad
shadow across the girdling Guadalete, and that rich
undulating country which stretches far away beyond
it, pleased me so much that, dismounting at the foot
of the eminence, I seated myself among some fallen
walls and prostrate columns&mdash;doubtless fragments of
the ancient Arcobriga&mdash;to make a little sketch of the
place.
</p>

<p>
Reclined against a mass of vine-covered ruin, Slingsby
of "Ours" had fallen fast asleep with his horse's
bridle buckled over his left arm, and both he and the
nag occupied a prominent place in the foreground of
my view, and a wayside cross, covered with rich
creepers, and having a sulky-looking raven seated on
its summit, was in the middle distance.  My labours
proceeded rapidly and greatly to my own satisfaction
when they were suddenly interrupted by a heavy hand
being roughly laid on my shoulder.  I looked up.
Four men, muffled in the inevitable, invariable, and
eternal dirty brown cloak, in which we always see
the mysterious characters stride, swagger, and swell
on the boards of minor theatres, and which a
Spaniard is never without, under any circumstances,
appeared beside me.  Two had drawn swords, and
two cocked blunderbusses.
</p>

<p>
"The señores will understand that they are our
prisoners?" said one.
</p>

<p>
"Who the deuce are you&mdash;comrades of Don
Fabrique, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid! we are honest men&mdash;alguazils of
Arcos, and the Caballeros must both come before the
señor alcalde."
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose?" I demanded hastily.
</p>

<p>
"The señor will soon be informed," said one.
</p>

<p>
"To his cost, perhaps," added a second.
</p>

<p>
"Vaya, come along," growled a third, "or it may
be the worse for you."
</p>

<p>
Finding expostulation vain, I roused Jack, who
after revolving in his own mind whether or not he
ought to revolve them&mdash;for his pistol had six barrels,
we took our horses by their bridles, and accompanied
the bravo-like alguazils, whose good-will we sought
to cultivate by being liberal with our cases of
cheroots.
</p>

<p>
The alcalde, a bustling little manufacturer of Cordovan
leather, received us in his office, stuck his
barnacles on his nose, summoned his escribano, and
opened the case with an air of awful pomp and chilling
consequence; but he seemed to be about as well
qualified for the office of lawgiver as Mr. Justice
Shallow.
</p>

<p>
"The señores, who seemed to be British officers
belonging to the garrison of Gibraltar, of which her
Most Catholic Majesty Donna Isabella is sovereign,
whatever Queen Victoria may assert to the contrary,
were found making a sketch&mdash;a military sketch, no
doubt&mdash;of her ancient city of Arcos, in the province
of Andalusia; and the señores, of course, knew the
law framed by the Cortes on that point."
</p>

<p>
"Of sketching the city of Arcos?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"Any city," returned the fussy little alcalde.
</p>

<p>
"But this is not a fortified town."
</p>

<p>
"But it might be fortified."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt&mdash;but it is not fortified at the present
moment."
</p>

<p>
"Tonto de mi! what does that matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Why you stupid old&mdash;&mdash;" Jack Slingsby was
beginning, but I placed a hand upon his mouth, and
the irritable little alcalde continued.
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose was the sketch&mdash;this sketch
made?&mdash;answer me that, señor."
</p>

<p>
"To please myself and to show my friends."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, a likely story truly," he sneered, as he
deliberately tore my poor production into several
pieces, threw them into the brassero of charcoal
which glowed in the centre of the apartment, and
watched until every fragment was entirely consumed.
I gazed at him in silence, but feeling an emotion of
considerable disgust; for although well aware that to
sketch any fortified place or garrison town, barrack,
or citadel, was strictly forbidden, it never occurred to
me that the restriction could apply to the miserable
conglomeration of Spanish huts and crumbling
Moorish hovels which clustered round the churches
on the rock of Arcos; but in their ignorance of the
arts the Spaniards, like the Turks, cannot see a
difference between a little artistic sketch and a regular
plan drawn for the most desperate military purposes.
</p>

<p>
"So we are suspected of being spies," said Slingsby;
"I am glad that sketching was omitted in my
education, and that I never could draw aught but a
cork or a bill in my life."
</p>

<p>
"But this may prove no matter for laughter, Jack,"
said I, as the alcalde, with awful gravity, after duly
entering our names and designations in a huge tome,
turned to another part thereof, wiped his spectacles
and addressed us.  I must own to feeling some
uneasiness, having once had a brother officer who went
on sick leave to Cadiz, where he was shot as a
Christino priest; he was our senior lieutenant, poor Bob
Rasper, and was as much like a priest as the great
Mogul.  I had an uncle who was very near being
strangled by an alcalde, who was persuaded he was
Don Carlos; and we all know that Lord Carnarvon
was well nigh murdered in mistake for Don Miguel,
while Captain Widrington was about to be garotted
by another official, who thought he might be an
agent of Marshal Baldomero Espartero, now first
minister of Donna Isabella II.  These instances of
Spanish justice, clearness, and legal acumen were
floating before me when the little ruffian of an
alcalde curled up his mustachios and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The señores will have passports, no doubt?"
</p>

<p>
"No passports," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Demonio!" ejaculated this Andalusian Solon,
while the alguazils (having finished their cheroots)
began to clank their sabres and cock their ominous-looking
trabujos.  "Then you must both be sent to
prison in irons, and kept under guard until we
communicate with Espartero."
</p>

<p>
We lost alike our patience and temper at this piece
of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
"Beware, señor alcalde," said I, "for the very
person you have named may send you to the galleys for
this insolent interference.  We are two British officers
going on public duty to Seville, and being passed
through the Spanish lines by the officer commanding
there, require no other passports than our swords and
our uniform, which you had better respect, or we may
play a mischief with you.  Our ambassador at
Madrid&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Vaya usted a los infernos!" exclaimed the alcalde,
in a towering fit of official indignation; "I shall show
you how we treat those who enter our city of Arcos
without proper credentials, and I verily believe you
to be a couple of pitiful raterillos.  Search and secure
them!"
</p>

<p>
How this affair might have ended, I have no means
of knowing; but nothing saved us from much trouble
and perhaps danger, but the sudden discovery of a
letter, which was found by one of the alguazils who
rudely plunged a hand into one of my pockets.  It
was addressed in high-flowing terms to the most
illustrious señor, the captain general of Andalusia,
and bore the great official seal of the Governor of Her
Britannic Majesty's garrison of Gibraltar.  On
beholding this, the countenance of the alcalde fell.  This
human bladder, which was inflated by so much wrath
and Jack-in-office pride, suddenly collapsed.  His
manner changed at once; he was profuse in his
apologies, and on a wave of his hand, those alguazils who,
a moment before, were ready to drag us to some foul
prison and rudely too, like ruffians as they doubtless
were, slunk aside and withdrew; and in five minutes
after we were mounted, clear of Arcos, and trotting
along the road which ascended from the banks of the
Guadalete.
</p>

<p>
"Those Spaniards will never change," said Jack;
"they will ever be bullies or cravens; so cudgels
or cannon shot are the only means of argument with
them."
</p>

<p>
We then laughed at the whole affair&mdash;at the absurd
pomposity of the alcalde, and the idea of our being
arrested as spies.
</p>

<p>
At a trot we traversed the little town of Alcantarilla.
It lies not far from the Guadalquiver, a stream that
wanders through a fertile hollow, which in the days
of the Cæsars was a hopeless march.  We crossed
the bridge which was built by the hands of the
Romans, who placed a tower at each end for defence.
Slingsby, with a waggish smile, recommended me to
make a sketch of these interesting remains; but a
wholesome terror of the alcalde of Arcos was yet too
fresh in my mind, so we pushed on towards Los
Palacies, in company with a long train of mules from
the seaport of San Lucar de Barameda.  Their drivers
were gaily attired, and were all sturdy and hearty
fellows, who beguiled the way with stories, laughter, and
songs of love and wine, or legends of the Avalos, the
Moors of Ronda, and of Bravonnel the Moor of
Zaragozza and his ladylove Guadalara, while they sung
to the cracking of their whips, the merry jangle of the
mule-bells, and the thrum of a guitar.  With all this,
they were prepared for every emergency, having
poniards, blunderbusses, and other weapons&mdash;being
armed to the teeth, in fact; and with them we travelled
until Seville rose before us, with the fretted spires
and gothic pinnacles of its cathedral and Alcazar,
and the gigantic tower of La Giralda, rising above
the domes of the Mohammedan times and the befrays
of the Christians; and all steeped in the unclouded
blaze of an Andalusian sunset, with the Guadalquiver
winding through a low valley in the foreground,
bordered by groves of the orange and citron, and the
green undulating ridges of the Sierra towering in the
distance, with a golden vapour resting on the
mellowed peaks, which bound a landscape that, in the
days of Alfonso the Wise, was studded by a hundred
thousand cottages and oil-mills.
</p>

<p>
But the Guadalquiver seemed as muddy as the
Thames, where it approaches the ancient fane of St. John
of Alfarache, and there its turgid tide was lashed
and beaten by the steamers from San Lucar; and we
could see them ploughing their way (with red lights
hanging at their fore cross-trees) into the evening haze
that settled over Seville.
</p>

<p>
Our passports were demanded by the officer commanding
an ill-accoutered guard at the gate: but our
letter addressed to the captain general freed us from
further question, and he politely directed us to an
hotel.
</p>

<p>
We rode through the grass-grown streets of the
lazy Sevillanos, I reflecting on stories of Pedro the
Cruel and the past glories of the Arab city&mdash;Jack
Slingsby reflecting on the thoroughfares, which he
said "were remarkably dingy, devilish dirty, and all
that sort of thing," until we discovered the hotel de
la Reyna near the Lonja, or Exchange, and close to
the far-famed cathedral church.  There we took up
our quarters for the night.
</p>

<p>
"At last we are in Seville!" said I, as I threw myself
into a down fauteuil, after tossing off a glass of
iced Valdepenas, and flung aside the last week's
Madrid papers, the 'Heraldo' and 'España;' "in
Seville, where Trajan, Adrian, and Theodosius were
born, and where&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You shall flirt with the pretty Paulina to-morrow,"
said Jack; "pass over the decanter; thanks;
I can take you off your stilts in a twinkling, my boy."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE TERTULIA.
</h3>

<p>
In the morning, after coffee, a devilled bone and a
cigar, we sallied forth to deliver the dispatch of our
Governor to the captain general, and resolved, soon
after, to bid farewell to Seville; for Jack was full of fears
that the whole corps would be off, bag and baggage, to
fight the Russians before we could return.  The hour
was somewhat early, so we rambled about the beautiful
city; but I do not mean to inflict upon the reader
a description of all we saw&mdash;of the gay crowds who
thronged the Plaza de Toros and the Alameda, with
fan and mantilla, sombrero and mantle; of the
cathedral of Santa Maria, with its carved buttresses and
stupendous spires; of the Alcazar or palace of the
Moorish kings, with all its arabesques and oval arches;
of the Lonja and the huge tobacco factory.  I beg
my reader to imagine them all, for I could easily
devote five several chapters to describing these five
several edifices.  It is enough that the Sevillanos have
an ancient proverb, that he who never saw Seville has
never seen a wonder; to wit&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Que en no ha visto Sevilla,<br />
  Ne ha visto Maravilla."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As we issued from the cathedral, Jack's loquacity
was somewhat stilled by the grandeur of that stupendous
pile and its dark Murillos, the chief of which
is the adoration of the Saviour by St. Anthony of
Padua&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;of Lisbon and of Lagos&mdash;and
full of thoughts, which were rather solemn for
such fellows as we are, we walked slowly on with our
eyes fixed on the far-famed tower of the weathercock&mdash;the
Giralda&mdash;which rises at the north-east angle of
the church, when a personage, whose eyes were raised
to the same altitude, came somewhat violently against
us, and then we poured forth mutual apologies.
</p>

<p>
"Maldito&mdash;come esta, señores; well met."
</p>

<p>
"Come esta, señor major&mdash;who would have thought
of meeting you here?"
</p>

<p>
"Why so?" asked Don Joaquim, for he proved to
be our friend of the noble regiment of Lagos; "I
think that I mentioned Seville as my native city&mdash;so
you have reached the end of your journey?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and mean to leave this to-morrow," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"So early!  Maldito&mdash;a short visit.  Is your
business so soon concluded?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not yet begun; we have a dispatch for the
captain general."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said he, with wonder in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Where is his palace?  We were just about to
inquire the way."
</p>

<p>
"You must pass the Lonja, our famous Exchange,
a triumph of the genius of Juan de Herrera&mdash;the
architect of the Escurial; well, you must pass it, and
cross the Plaza de Toros; but allow me to have the
pleasure of escorting you."
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks."
</p>

<p>
"None are necessary, señores&mdash;hut this dispatch
for the captain general&mdash;Maldito!  I am bursting
with irrepressible curiosity to know what it is about.
Are we going to war with Russia too?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, señor," said I, "we may as well inform
you that it concerns the killing of a man on board of
a Spanish government guarda costa, by a chance shot
from the Mole Fort at Gibraltar."
</p>

<p>
"He was in pursuit of a contrabandista, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, those rascally contrabandistas!  It is too bad
of your Government to protect them&mdash;quite as bad as
making war on the Chinese because they would not
poison themselves with opium.  I heard that some
of your people had shot at a guarda costa, and killed
some one on hoard.  It has excited considerable
animosity, and been much spoken of."
</p>

<p>
He led us through several dark and narrow streets,
so narrow, indeed, that people could easily have shaken
hands from the windows on each side of these quaint
old Moorish thoroughfares.  Issuing suddenly into
the full Haze of the scorching Spanish sunshine, we
found ourselves before a handsome palace decorated
by Corinthian pilasters, and having its lofty windows
covered by external shades of brilliant red and white
striped stuff.  Two sentinels of the line stood at the
portal under sunshades, with their muskets "ordered;"
and they stared at our uniform with black and
lacklustre eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The palace of the captain general," said Don
Joaquim, bowing; "he has just returned from
Jaen, having gone on a pilgrimage to the Holy
Face."
</p>

<p>
"We must have the pleasure of meeting you again,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"Our hotel is the Queen's&mdash;de la Reyna&mdash;near the
Exchange," added Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know the place very well," replied the Don,
producing his card, a token of civilisation little known
in Spain; "my mother gives a tertulia to-night, and
we shall be delighted to see you&mdash;her reception hour
is eight&mdash;Donna Dominga de Lucena&mdash;Calle del
Alcazar."
</p>

<p>
"You are the son of Donna Dominga, whom we
had the pleasure of knowing in Gibraltar?"
</p>

<p>
"The same, señores.  Are you the gentlemen who
were so kind and attentive to her?  It is quite a little
romance this meeting.  How odd, to think that we
sat a whole night in the venta of Castellar and knew
nothing about this!  Then, doubtless, one of you
must be that accomplished cavalier, Don Leja Mag
Leja, concerning whom she wrote me so many letters
when I was at Lagos."
</p>

<p>
With some laughter, we professed that neither of
us was the portly Leechy Mac Leechy, to whose
name the Donna had given somewhat of a Castilian
character in her epistles to the major.
</p>

<p>
"But about the tertulia? we have no full uniform,"
urged Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Full uniform&mdash;bagatella!&mdash;stuff&mdash;come just as
you are; but as your business here is about that
unlucky guarda costa, 'tis as well my brother Hernan
has not arrived; for he is in our naval service, and
might feel piqued on the subject.  Well, addio&mdash;I
shall see you at eight to-night&mdash;don't forget, the
street of the Alcazar," and with a salute he left us.
</p>

<p>
The sentinels at the door "handled" their arms as
we ascended the flight of marble steps which led to
the door of the captain general's palace.
</p>

<p>
"The last general officer with whom I had the
honour of an interview was old Towler, of the Kilkenny
district," said Slingsby; "I have no idea what
manner of man our Spaniard may be."
</p>

<p>
As the interview with the captain-general and all
the various pros and cons thereanent&mdash;as a Scotsman
would say&mdash;may have appeared already among the
public intelligence of "our own correspondent," who
most likely was not in Seville, and knew nothing
about the matter, I will only state that we were
received with great urbanity and politeness by the
Spanish officer who held the important post of
Governor of the four kingdoms.  He was a fine old
cavalier, and in earlier years had served in the
Peninsular war; he told us that he had commanded a
regiment under Cuesta; a brigade of Cazadores under
Hill, and a division under Murillo; that he had been
wounded at Vittoria in attacking the heights of La
Puebla, and had received the Grand Cross of the
Bath from the hand of the Duke of Wellington, and
latterly the Order of Carlos III., which devoted him
"to the pure conception of the blessed Virgin Mary,"
from the Queen and the Patriarch of the Indies, at
the solemn chapter held in 1853.  The old fellow's
eyes kindled with pleasure as he invited us to
lunch, and to share with him a bottle of choice
Valdepenas, saying that he loved the sight of the
red coat for the memory of the olden time that
would never come again&mdash;the poor red coats&mdash;he had
often seen them lying thick enough on many a Spanish
plain, and in many a crumbling breach and trench&mdash;at
Badajoz, at Ciudad Rodrigo, San Sebastian and
Tarifa.
</p>

<p>
Here, at least, was one noble old Spanish soldier&mdash;one
true cavalier&mdash;whose lively recollection of those
great campaigns (which are second to none the world
has seen) and whose sense of what his country owed
to ours, formed a strong contrast to that cold
ingratitude which desecrated the tomb of the Scottish hero
of Corunna, and ploughed up the graves of our brave
men, who were buried in the little field beneath the
ramparts of Tarifa; and for the repose of whose
bones our Government had to pay a sum to Spain.
</p>

<p>
We received from him a letter to the Governor of
Gibraltar, stating that our explanations of the affair of
the guarda costa had perfectly satisfied him; and on
our rising to retire he made us an offer of a cavalry
escort as far as San Roque, which lies within a few
miles of our garrison; but being aware that we should
be obliged to maintain both the horses and the men,
and to make them a handsome donation at parting, I
declined, saying that we had an idea of returning by
San Lucar de Barameda, and would there take the
steamer for Gibraltar.
</p>

<p>
"But remember there is that restless gentleman,
Don Fabrique de Urquija," said the general, smiling;
"he makes the roads very unsafe, and does not hesitate
to commit such outrages as have not been known in
the land since Marshal Massena marched through it."
</p>

<p>
We assured him of our being without fear in the
matter; on which he laughed, saying that he knew
"los Brittanicos, of old, and that, like our fathers
who fought under Wellington, Hill, and Grahame, we
also were without fear," and we parted, highly
flattered and delighted by our interview with this old
Castilian hidalgo.
</p>

<p>
We lounged long in the Alameda, where the notice
our uniform attracted was rather an annoyance.
After dining at the hotel and making the most of
our costume that our light marching order would
admit, we appeared at the door of Donna Dominga's
residence in the Calle del Alcazar, just as the
cathedral clock struck eight; for the Spaniards are too
well bred to esteem any one the more for being late
at a conversazione, for such is a tertulia in fact and in
effect.
</p>

<p>
A number of sedans, borne by servants in livery,
were standing about the steps of the mansion; and
the links and torches flared on the coats of arms that
decorated the panels and the collars of Santiago
and Calatrava which surrounded them.  Various
long-visaged and spindle-shanked representatives of
the pure did blood of los Cuatros Reinos, untainted
by the stain of Moor, or Jew, or heretic, were
stalking through the vestibule with due gravity and
grandeur.
</p>

<p>
We were ushered forward by one servant, and
were announced by another on entering the saloon,
where our old friend Donna Dominga sat with fan
and snuff-box in hand receiving her guests; and as
her son had prepared her for our visit, she was in a
prodigious flutter, with her fat round face forming
the apex of a pyramid of black satin and black Cadiz
lace; for her veil, which was of the finest texture,
fell over all her person.
</p>

<p>
By her side sat the pretty Paulina on a rich low
tabourette, gracefully as a Spanish lady sits at mass,
or a Moorish maiden on her little carpet, for it is
from their Arabian conquerors that the low seats of
the Spanish dames are borrowed.
</p>

<p>
The major, who wore the blue uniform and massive
silver epaulettes of "the noble Regiment of
St. Anthony," and who had the order of St. John of
Portugal on his breast, hurried forward to meet and
to present us.  Then the younger donna blushed
crimson, while the elder wished very much to do so
too, and dropping her eyelids, fanned herself, and
affected to be much agitated.  We bowed very low
and then stepped back, as it is not the custom in
Spain to shake hands.  After a few of those
complimentary remarks and those commonplaces, which
are customary in every country, we should have withdrawn
a little to make way for other tertulianos, had
not Donna Dominga especially invited us to remain
beside her; and while the presentation continued,
and all that were noble (being rich or beautiful went
for nought in Seville) appeared in succession, and
while caballeros and grave and solemn hidalgos, with
the red cross of Calatrava, and the little sword of
San Jago dangling at their button-holes, advanced
slowly, and with a faint smile and courtly bow laid a
hand on their heart and lisped the usual and invariable
"A los pies de usted, señoras" (I am at your
feet, ladies), and then retired; I was chatting gaily
with Paulina, who had now become more assured,
and who overwhelmed me with a thousand inquiries
about Gibraltar and her friends.  Meantime that
rogue Jack Slingsby poured into her mother's ear
pretended messages from MacLeechy, our doctor&mdash;messages
so tender and so pitiful that the old lady
relented and forgave him being married, saying it
was "his misfortune, not his fault, poor man;" Jack
asserted his belief that the doctor was quite of her
opinion; and then the bulbous-shaped fair one made
a vigorous use of her fan and snuff-box, as she
conjured up the image of the "gay deceiver."
</p>

<p>
The saloon was a large apartment; the floor was
of polished oak, and was varnished until it shone
like glass; the ceiling was of cedar, and divided into
deep, dark panels; the walls were painted white, and
were hung with several dusky pictures, principally of
religious subjects; one of these was by Roelas;
another by Murillo, and both had narrowly escaped
abstraction by the French, during the War of
Independence, for Messrs. Soult, Suchet, and Co., made
everything march over the Pyrenees that was neither
too hot nor too heavy.
</p>

<p>
Our garrison evening parties in Gibraltar had
shown Donna Dominga that considerable improvements
might be made upon the solemn gravity of
the Spanish tertulia; thus the company were pressed
to stay longer than usual in honour of us; we had
a few airs on the piano&mdash;a very antique instrument,
said to have been found among Joseph's baggage at
Vittoria, and in no way calculated to give full effect
to the compositions of Donizetti, Verdi, or Orsini,
which Paulina and her companions attempted to
give us; but then they had their guitars, and the
lively songs of old Spain, and legendary ballads of
the brave Avalos of the Ronda, which if destitute
of science, had at least the merit of being full of
music and melody.
</p>

<p>
Every sound was hushed as Paulina sang the song
which was wont to turn the heads of half Her Majesty's
garrison.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Since for kissing thee, Minguillo,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother's ever scolding me;<br />
  Give me swiftly back, O dear one,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the kiss I gave to thee!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Either by chance, or an irresistible inclination,
our eyes met just as she sang these very tender
and pointed words, and a soft tinge shot over her
pure white cheek.  My own heart filled with a tumult
of emotion, for the aspect of this noble Spanish
girl, as she sat on the low tabourette, in an attitude
full of grace, with her high proud head and the long
veil of black lace that fell from it over her back and
shoulders, was so bewildering, that I felt convinced
my peace of mind would require an explanation with
her before my bantering mentor and I turned our
horses' heads once more towards Gibraltar.
</p>

<p>
We had now a little waltzing, and a quadrille or
two, with plenty of groseille and fleur d'orange.
</p>

<p>
I had a thousand things to tell Paulina; but
when she was the centre of almost every eye in the
room, it was no easy matter to be tender; besides,
whenever I looked round, the comical eye of Jack
Slingsby, with a glass stuck in it, was sure to meet
mine; for whatever he was about, in the waltz, the
quadrille, in a quiet two-handed flirtation (which, by
the way, made the old hidalgos of Seville, who are
not wont to tolerate such things, shrug their shoulders
and elevate their eyebrows) in the middle of a tender
speech, when handing fleur d'orange, restoring a
fallen fan, or reclasping a bracelet, he seemed to
watch all my proceedings with a species of amused
interest&mdash;so that nothing passed between Paulina and
me but the merest commonplaces.
</p>

<p>
"The moment so ardently wished for has arrived
at last," thought I; "she is beside me, and I have
not one word of interest for her."
</p>

<p>
"And you leave Seville to-morrow?" said she, to
break an awkward pause.
</p>

<p>
"No, señora, in two days."
</p>

<p>
"A short visit&mdash;there are so many things to see
here.  There is the great tower of Cabildo with its
enchanted weathercock, a Pallas with a standard which
always indicates the quarter from which an enemy is
approaching Seville."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;yes; I remember in the adventure of Don
Quixotte with the Knight of the Wood, the latter
boasts, that among other deeds done in honour of his
mistress, he 'had challenged the famous fighting
giantess, La Giralda of Seville, who is strong and
undaunted as one who is made of brass.'"
</p>

<p>
"And who without changing place is the most
inconstant woman in the world.  Oh, Don Quixotte, he
is charming!  And then in Seville we have the letters
of Francisco Pizzaro, of Columbus and the valiant
Hernan Cortes; and more than all, we have the cathedral
with its Puerta de Perdon, which was the work
of a Moorish necromancer, and was all built by a spell
between the night and morning.  In two days you
can never see all these things."
</p>

<p>
"Your own presence, Donna Paulina, is more than
enough to detain me here for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Then why go so soon?" she asked, with her pretty
Spanish lisp, while her long lashes drooped.
</p>

<p>
"Go I must, señora, for, being a soldier, I have
nothing to urge; but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what?"
</p>

<p>
"The stern necessity of obedience."
</p>

<p>
"Ay de mi!" said she, gazing fully and honestly at
me; "I am so sorry to hear all this."
</p>

<p>
"I am full of gratitude to hear you say so, señora;
but there is no remedy."
</p>

<p>
"Señor," said she, smiling, "para todo hay remedio
sino para la muerte."
</p>

<p>
"True, there is a remedy for everything but death,
it is a good old Spanish proverb," said I; "but is not
absence from those we love but a living death? so
when I am far from Seville I shall have but the memory
of one most beautiful face, and one bright happy
night."
</p>

<p>
"Take this rose," said she, disengaging one from
her bouquet; "it will be a memento, though a small
one."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, señora; but the rose will wither and fade."
</p>

<p>
"So will the memory of the beautiful face and the
one happy night," said she, with a winning smile.
</p>

<p>
"Never, never Paulina&mdash;you are so charming&mdash;so
gentle and so good, that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Dios Mio! the people are observing us,
and&mdash;but ave Maria purissima! what is the matter
with my mother?"
</p>

<p>
During this brief conversation, the servant Pedrillo
had delivered a note to Donna Dominga, who, on
hurriedly glancing at its contents, uttered a faint cry and
fell upon the sofa, where all the ladies crowded in an
excited manner round her.  Don Joaquim snatched
up the letter and read it with flaming eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What, in Heaven's name, is the matter?" I asked,
pressing forward.
</p>

<p>
"A letter has come from the captain of the guarda
costa, stating that the son of Donna Dominga, his
lieutenant, had been killed by a shot from the garrison of
Gibraltar," said Slingsby, in a rapid whisper.  "The
absence of the captain general at Jaen prevented the
Sevillanos from learning that the person slain was a
townsman.  I find we are in a mess here, and think
we had better be off, my boy."
</p>

<p>
Though Spain had a post-office in those days when
James III. of Scotland was fighting the battles of the
people against his traitorous nobility, and when the
brutal Henry of England was murdering his wives
and burning Catholics and Protestants together at
Smithfield, she has so far receded in the arts of peace
that this unfortunate letter had been all these many
weeks in finding its way from the sea port of Malaga
to Seville.
</p>

<p>
Don Joaquim now said something to Paulina, who
turned upon us with eyes full of grief and dismay.
</p>

<p>
"'T is my brother Hernan you have slain," she
exclaimed, in tones that went through me like a sword;
"O madre mia, madre mia! they have murdered our
dear, dear Hernan!" and she threw herself beside her
mother.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señores," said Don Joaquim, folding up the
letter with an air of sombre ferocity; "her accusation
is right, you have heard her; 't is my brother Don
Hernan who was killed by your accursed shot from
the mole fort of Gibraltar,&mdash;Hernan, lieutenant of the
guarda costa, and this letter is from his captain,
detailing the circumstances of that outrage on the Spanish
flag&mdash;an outrage of which I have heard so much since
I left Portugal; but which I little thought&mdash;O Dios
Mio! how little indeed, that it would bring such sorrow
to my own house, and to hearts to me so dear.  My
poor boy brother, Hernan!  So, señores, you it is,
who were the perpetrators of this foul act?  Fit men
you were, and proper too, to detail it to our blockhead
of a captain general, who was worshipping an old rag
at Jaen, when he should have been seeking vengeance
at Madrid.  But look ye, señores, I'll have it, sure and
deep, and as certainly as there is a saint in heaven,
sure as my name is Joaquim de Lucena of the regiment
of Lagos!"
</p>

<p>
"Mueran los gabachos&mdash;death to the miscreants!"
growled a number of voices, and I laid a hand on
my sword.  It was a natural impulse.
</p>

<p>
The ladies clustered like a brood of terrified doves
round Donna Dominga and her daughter; the gentlemen
drew round her son; Slingsby and I were left
together in the middle of the large saloon.
</p>

<p>
"A pleasant predicament this!" said Jack, shrugging
his shoulders: "Ramble, I think we had better
retire."
</p>

<p>
"To remain is useless, for these people are alike
past listening to explanation or apology," I replied;
and with an emotion of mortification and sorrow, which
the reader may easily imagine, we took up our
swords, made a profound bow to this ungracious
company (none of whom responded), and quitted the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Awful business this," said Jack, "is it not, Dick
Ramble?&mdash;speak&mdash;have you lost your tongue?"
</p>

<p>
"A strange combination of unfortunate circumstances!
To find ourselves the honoured guests of
the very woman whose son we slew!  In what light
will Paulina view us, and Don Joaquim too?"
</p>

<p>
"As an officer he ought to be aware that we did
but our duty," urged poor Jack, who felt himself the
most guilty party; "but I did not half like the
expression of his eyes as we left the saloon."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"I read in them more of hatred and malice, than
of horror for the event, or natural grief for his brother's
fate."
</p>

<p>
"You think so?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the man is a Spaniard."
</p>

<p>
"And being so, will not let us off easily."
</p>

<p>
"We shall have a message from him in the morning,
challenging us both to fight, you think?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all; your Spaniards don't fight duels; he
will lay some desperate snare for us between this and
San Roque; so, depend upon it, the sooner we make
ourselves scarce in Seville the better.  But here is
the hotel&mdash;for Heaven's sake let us have some iced
champagne, for this horrid business has made me as
thirsty as if I had crossed a whole county in the
hottest hunting season."
</p>

<p>
I must own that though I was pretty well assured
of the truth of Jack's surmises and suspicions, fear
for my own safety was quite a secondary emotion to
my sincere sorrow for the bereavement we had
occasioned to poor old Donna Dominga and the lively
Paulina.  As for that stormy fellow Joaquim, I felt no
compunction for him in the least; his grief was too
noisy, and his sudden hostility too deep to leave much
room for natural sorrow; and so, while surmising,
considering, revolving, and talking the matter
threadbare, we finished several bottles of champagne;
through the medium of these we easily came to the
conclusion that we were the most injured parties;
that we had been grossly insulted somehow, over
night&mdash;that the usual satisfaction was necessary; and
then we retired to bed in a state of just and proper
indignation at the malevolent threats of Don Joaquim
and his friends, to whom the affair formed a notable
subject for discussion at those morning meetings,
which are so dearly prized by the Spaniards, who then
debate everything from a ballet girl's ancle to a rising
in Catalonia; and for these gossips, the place of
rendezvous in Seville is the Plaza de San Domingo.

CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
DON FABRIQUE.
</h3>

<p>
We were awake betimes in the morning, and breakfasted
early, in the true Spanish style, on good stiff
chocolate with fried eggs, purple wine, and
snow-white bread; but no hostile message came from Don
Joaquim.  The hours stole on, and the sunlit streets
threw the shadows of their picturesque façades
against each other.  The events of the last night,
and their probable consequences, had given us a decided
distaste for prowling about the streets of Seville.
We were both somewhat thoughtful, and said little,
or conferred only on the nearest route by which we
could reach Gibraltar, in coming from which, we had
made somewhat of a détour; and Jack hinted that we
should probably have some more brawls with alcaldes,
rows at posadas, skirmishes with banditos, and other
pleasant adventures, before we reported ourselves "as
just arrived" at head quarters.
</p>

<p>
"A letter for El Señor Capitano Don Ricardo,"
said the waiter, approaching.
</p>

<p>
"A letter for you, Dick," said Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"So it has come at last," said I, breaking the seal.
</p>

<p>
"Will it be an affair of knives or pistols?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said I, as the waiter retired.
</p>

<p>
"Slugs in a saw-pit, and all that sort of thing&mdash;a
triangular duel, eh?  But an officer should have
brought it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, had it been that for which you seem so very
anxious."
</p>

<p>
"Anxious! not I, believe me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is from a lady."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce&mdash;you quite interest me.  I can perceive
that it is penned on pink paper, a little
flourished, but without signature.  It is from Paulina,
poor girl!  I can imagine her writing it, and as
Byron says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'How tremulously gentle, her small hand&mdash;'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"How can you run on thus?" I asked, imploringly.
"Fie upon you, Jack, after all the misery we have
wrought to these poor people."
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps you are right and I am wrong.  I
beg pardon; but the letter&mdash;what is it about?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the safety of our lives."
</p>

<p>
"Our lives&mdash;indeed&mdash;how so?"
</p>

<p>
"Read it."
</p>

<p>
The note ran thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"SENOR DON RICARDO.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"In the name of the Blessed Mother of God, I
implore you and your friend to leave Seville on receipt
of this, and to take the nearest road for San Lucar
de Barameda, where you can reach a steamer, which
sails direct for Gibraltar.  Don Joaquim vows to
have a terrible revenge for the death of our dear
brother Hernan; and, last night, was seen in
conference with Fabrique de Urquija on the old Alameda.
The road you came will be beset&mdash;his band are,
doubtless, now in hire to waylay you.  El santo de
los Santos, forgive you the misery you have caused to
those who never wronged you, and may it deliver
you from the snares of death that lie in your
homeward path."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"More melodramatic than pleasant," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"It is from Paulina, no doubt.&mdash;how considerate!"
</p>

<p>
"Kind and gentle too," added Jack.  "Well, all
things duly considered, I think we should take her
advice&mdash;mount, and be off."
</p>

<p>
"Poor&mdash;poor Paulina!"
</p>

<p>
"Deuce take it, Dick, don't be faint-hearted.
'T will be all one when the route comes for the
Crimea, and sell or sail is the word."
</p>

<p>
"Not among "Ours," I hope."
</p>

<p>
"The San Lucar road be it."
</p>

<p>
"Then the sooner we leave the better, for we have
much to lose and nothing to gain by lingering here."
</p>

<p>
"For there is neither law, justice, nor honour
among these Spaniards," said Slingsby, making a
smart application to the bell-rope.
</p>

<p>
"What! you say so in the face of this charming
letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Charming, indeed, to be told that a captain of
robbers&mdash;a picturesque ruffian in a steeple-crowned
hat and red garters, has been bribed to cut your
throat&mdash;to 'do' for you in the flower of your youth
for a hundred pistoles."
</p>

<p>
The letter raised a glow of sad, of kind, and
regretful emotions within me; but I stifled them all,
and, calling for the bill, settled with the landlord
in person.
</p>

<p>
"What manner of magistrates have you here in
Seville?" asked the unwary Jack.
</p>

<p>
"How, señor?"
</p>

<p>
"When they permit thieves to prowl about your
streets at night."
</p>

<p>
"Thieves, señor&mdash;Ave Maria!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thieves, señor patron.  Fabrique de Urquija
was on the old Alameda last night with a
well-known bravo from Portugal."
</p>

<p>
"Don Fabrique," reiterated our host, aghast at the
name; "ah, he is too great a man to be easily
arrested, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Is he not a mere ladrone?"
</p>

<p>
"True, Caballero; but then his band is numerous.
Yes, señor; Ave Maria purissima!&mdash;tiene con
exercito de 10,000 hombres&mdash;all determined men, and
armed to the teeth."
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand men&mdash;nonsense!  A hundred,
more probably."
</p>

<p>
The host felt his veracity impugned, and he called
upon all the saints in the calendar to witness the
truth of his assertions; and while we had a decanter
of wine before starting, he told us a vast number of
anecdotes, descriptive of the cruel and unscrupulous
character of the so-called Don Fabrique.  Two of
these occurred to me as being peculiarly diabolical in
their nature.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion he plundered the house of a
wealthy merchant near Estephana, a town on the
Grenada coast; and because the unfortunate
proprietor would not yield up the alleged treasures of
his strong box, and sign bills on his bankers in
Seville, Fabrique snatched up a camphine lamp from
a marble side-table, and, with a dreadful oath, poured
the contents over the hair and whiskers of his
prisoner.  He then deliberately applied a lighted candle
thereto, and in a moment the whole face and head of
the miserable man were enveloped in flames.  His
skull was roasted like a large castano, and he died in
great misery&mdash;his head being literally burned off!
</p>

<p>
Another amiable little trait of Don Fabrique was
the strange way he took to remove his predecessor
from the command of the troop.  This was a rough
old guerilla, who in his youth had fought in the
campaigns of Wellington, under Don Julian Sanchez,
the famous Captain Harelip, as our soldiers named
him, and latterly in the service of the Carlists, under
the banished Conde de Morella.
</p>

<p>
The robber captain&mdash;Gomes el Guerilla&mdash;having
incurred the animosity of Fabrique, that worthy
procured some gun-cotton (which our patron believed to
be a preparation by the devil himself), from a
drug-chest, when investigating the shop of a botarico
(apothecary) at Castellar; and some of this he placed
in the folds of Gomes' neckcloth in the night, and for
three days the old and unsuspecting sinner wore this
dreadful thing under his well-bearded chin.  On
the third, Fabrique, who began to lose patience, and
vow to have vengeance on the botarico, said, "Come,
señor, let us make up a little cigar;" so the cigar
was made, and they proceeded to smoke, until some
sparks fell on the breast of the old guerilla; and
then, Madre de Dios! there was a dreadful flash and
explosion like that of a cannon; and to the consternation
of all his band, the head of Gomes was blown
right off his shoulders, and not a vestige of it was
ever seen again.
</p>

<p>
"The noble Caballeros," continued our host, "have
no doubt heard of the great robber-chief, Manuel de
Cordova, who in January, 1853, killed the commandant
of the civic guard of Bute?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"He was betrayed by Don Fabrique, and shot to
death by a platoon of infantry, in the Plaza of
Cordova.  Oh, señor, the saints deliver us from the
devil and Don Fabrique!"
</p>

<p>
"So say I," added Jack, as the landlord left us, and
thus, being impressed alike by these communications
and that of Donna Paulina, we resolved to change
our route and avoid this formidable personage who
took such an interest in our proceedings.
</p>

<p>
To deceive any person who might be watching
about the hotel, or be bribed by Fabrique, or the
major, we made particular inquiries of the patron,
the waiters, and stable-boys concerning the road to
Gibraltar by the way of Puerto Serrano; and having,
as Jack said, "completely thrown dust in their eyes,"
we took the route to San Lucar and left Seville at a
rapid trot about an hour after noon, pausing only to
give a peseta to a poor Franciscan who begged from
us at the city gate.
</p>

<p>
I looked back to Seville as we galloped away.
</p>

<p>
The tower of La Giralda and all its spires were
sinking in the sunny haze and lessening in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
"So ends an intimacy that might have ripened into
something better," thought I.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE RATERILLO.
</h3>

<p>
Passing Coria del Rio, a little province and partido,
after a twenty miles' ride we halted to dine at
Lebrija, which is so famed for its oil of olives, and
there we got some prime Xeres, which bore the
private mark of the señores Gonzalez and Dubose, the
famous wine merchants; and now we enjoyed the
hope that our acquaintance Fabrique de Urquija and
his "ten thousand hombres" (or whatever their
number might be) were sunning themselves on the
mountains, and lying in wait for us on the dusty road by
Puerto Serrano; and any anxiety we might have felt
to reach the coast unmolested began to lessen when
we set forth again, while the evening sun was verging
towards the western sierras of the province, and
pursuing an old and narrow path, so old that perhaps
the Christian knights of King Ferdinand might have
traversed it to battle with the Emirs of Granada, of
Seville, and Cordova, we rode on, amid varied scenery,
where luxuriant creepers almost veiled the granite
rocks like natural curtains, where large fields of maize
surrounded ancient villages left ruined and roofless in
the late civil wars, where herds of half wild cattle
browsed on the green mountain slope; where the
dead man's cross, the wayside chapel, the groves of
cork, of olive or orange trees bordered the devious
path, and the shattered atalaya that whilome watched
the frontiers of Mohammed of Cadiz, towered over all,
a landmark to the Guadalquiver.
</p>

<p>
Charmed by the scenery, we allowed the reins to
fall on the necks of our horses, and careless as to
whether or not we found quarters for the night in an
olive wood or in Trohniona, which we were now
approaching, and the little spire of which we saw
peeping above its bright green groves and tipped with a
fiery gleam, we rode on slowly until near a well
which flowed into a stone basin, under a rude
representation of our Lady of Assistance&mdash;a wayside
chapel, in fact&mdash;a turn of the path brought us
suddenly upon two armed Spaniards, who were seated on
the sward playing with cards in the twilight, for the
time was evening now.
</p>

<p>
One of these, by his gay attire, his embroidered
jacket with its silver clasps, his sash of red and
yellow stripes and his velvet hat, as well as by the
horse which stood near him, well laden with packages,
and having a long gun slung at its demipique
saddle, I perceived to be a professed smuggler; and
on our nearer approach we both recognised our old
friend Pedro el Contrabandista, who supplied our
mess with cigars, and whose unlucky pursuit by the
guarda costa had been the source of so much
travelling, turmoil, and inquiry to Slingsby and to
myself.
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking the other as a raterillo&mdash;that
is, "a little rat," or pickpocket, on whose
cloth the regular armed bandit who robs convoys,
fights the carabineros, and burns a village
occasionally, looks down as the line do on the militia, or
as the militia do on the yeomanry.  The only weapon
of the raterillo is his knife, and perhaps a concealed
pistol.  Polite almost to servility to the armed man,
the raterillo is usually a bully to the peaceable, and
to those who are too poor to carry that long musket
which is the constant companion of the provincial
Spaniard.
</p>

<p>
He doffed his threadbare sombrero and bowed with
great humility as we reined up beside them to greet
honest Pedro, who received us with a hearty shout of
welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Well, amigo mio," said I, "we were not aware
that you did business by land as well as by sea."
</p>

<p>
"True, señor, I should have been a woman, for I
am never constant to anything; I am glad to meet
two noble cavaliers of the garrison travelling here&mdash;but
why so far from Gibraltar, and without an escort?"
</p>

<p>
"All owing to you, Pedro, my valiant contrabandista,
and your troublesome affairs."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, señor, I do not comprehend."
</p>

<p>
"That devilish shot from the Mole fort."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;ha, ha! it cut in two halves Don
Hernan de Lucena, and enabled me to run my little
felucca safe into Gibraltar&mdash;eh."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we had to visit the captain general at
Seville, and to explain the affair to him in person.  So
we are here."
</p>

<p>
"On your way back."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so."
</p>

<p>
"I owe you a thousand thanks for that little piece
of attention from the Mole fort, señores; but for
that, I should now, perhaps, have been chained to an
oar in the Queen's galleys at Barcelona, for I was as
sure of being taken as there is a saint in heaven.
Well, señores, we shall sup together to-night at
Trohniona&mdash;see, yonder is its spire shining like a red
star in the sunset; I have my guitar, and shall sing
to you the newest seguidilla and some jovial romances
about the Granadine Moors, the Castilian Caballeros,
or the Carlists, and enchanters; but, meantime, I
must finish a game to which I was challenged by this
traveller, on whom I shall have, proper revenge, for
he has already won from me forty duros; and you
the while will do me the favour to accept some of my
best cigars."
</p>

<p>
There was no resisting this jolly contrabandista;
so, as we had before arranged to halt for the night
at Trohniona, we were the better for the companionship
of another man, who knew the country, and was
doubtless a favourite with the people, and who,
moreover, was well armed, stout, and determined.
We watched the game between him and the raterillo,
who won dollar after dollar with a facility that soon
left no doubt whatever in our minds that he was
cheating poor Pedro, so Jack and I exchanged
frequent glances.
</p>

<p>
"Whose cards are these?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The señor travalero's," said Pedro, "and I begin
to think he knows the backs better than the fronts of
them."
</p>

<p>
The raterillo, whose quick eyes rolled in a restless
manner, laughed as he pocketed three other duros of
Pedro, who began to lose all patience and to flush,
while a dark gleam shot over his eyes; and on
detecting in his adversary some real or suspected
piece of foul play, he dashed the cards full in his
face, crying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You are a rogue and a thief&mdash;a pitiful little rat,
and if you do not yield back every peseta you have
won, 'por el nombre de Dios,' I will be at you with
my Albacete knife!"
</p>

<p>
"Then the knife be it," retorted the raterillo,
crushing his well-worn hat over his eye-brows; "shall
we have our feet tied together?"
</p>

<p>
"No, we shall fight it out on the grass, and I will
have your black blood and my hard-won dollars
together," cried Pedro, who was choking with sudden
passion; and quick almost as thought, they confronted
each other, their dark faces contorted by ferocity, their
eyes flashing fire, their feet planted on the turf, their
bodies bent forward ready to spring, and their cuchillos
held firmly in the right hand, the thumb being pressed
upon the blade in such a manner as to enable them
to stab or to cut with equal facility.
</p>

<p>
Several blows had been given and skilfully eluded
before Jack and I, who had drawn our swords, could
dismount and interfere; but just as we pressed in
between them, at the peril of our lives, we heard a cheer
like a yell ringing in the hollow, and saw a crowd of
armed men rushing down the sloping banks which
bordered the road-way.
</p>

<p>
"Ladrones&mdash;ladrones&mdash;fly, señores!" cried Pedro,
as he leaped on his horse and dashed at full speed
towards Trohniona, followed by several musket-bullets,
while the raterillo vanished in the twilight as
if the earth had swallowed him up.
</p>

<p>
In a moment we were surrounded by a crowd of
armed banditti&mdash;oh, there was no mistaking them!&mdash;I
was collared and pinioned just as my foot was in
the stirrup, and poor Jack Slingsby was knocked off
his horse by the butt-end of a long Spanish gun;
our swords and revolvers, our watches, rings, purses,
and cigar-cases; our horses and valises, all in a
moment became the spoil of the Egyptians, and we found
ourselves prisoners at the mercy of&mdash;Fabrique de
Urquija!

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
LA RIO DE MUERTE.
</h3>

<p>
Dark-visaged and black-bearded, with long sable hair
hanging over their collars from under their battered
sombreros, or gathered up in net-work cauls, the
robbers presented every picturesque variety of Spanish
costume.  Some wore jackets of black or olive-coloured
velvet, richly covered with needlework on the breast
and seams; their waists were girt by bright-coloured
sashes, and their legs encased in velvet small-clothes
and leathern gaiters; while others were sans shirts
and sans shoes; scantily attired in rough zamarras
of sheepskin, with tattered breeches&mdash;their brawny
legs and muscular chests being bare.  All were well
armed with muskets, Albacete knives, and pistols, and
all were ferocious, resolute, and reckless alike in spirit
and in aspect.  A glance showed me all this, as we
were dragged by them through an olive thicket, where,
upon the prostrate column of some old Roman
temple, we found their leader seated.
</p>

<p>
The moon had now risen brightly above the mountains,
and in the sashed and armed figure before me,
with a jacket glittering with embroidery, his carbine
resting in the hollow of his right arm, I recognised
our former acquaintance whom we had met by the
wayside between Castellar and Estrelo, and with whom
we were hobbing and nobbing over a cigar and bota,
when poor sister St. Veronica came to ask alms of us.
</p>

<p>
The cruelties of which, on that occasion, he had so
freely avowed himself guilty, and those other traits
of character, such as the affair of the camphine lamp
and the neckcloth so pleasantly padded with guncotton,
occurred to us; and I must own, that when we
found ourselves bound as prisoners and confronting
the cold, stern and impassible visage of this celebrated
Spanish outlaw, a restless anxiety made our hearts
throb with new and undefined emotions.  In all
things his bearing and disposition were similar to
those of his friend* whom he betrayed in 1853, and
whose atrocities have been published, like his own, at
length in the columns of the "Heraldo de Madrid."  Neither
Slingsby nor I had ever been in such a desperate
predicament before, as the reader may easily
conceive; thus we could scarcely realise it, and,
naturally enough, indignation was uppermost in our
minds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Francisco Manuel de Cordova.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The intellectual part of Fabrique's face, though
exceedingly handsome, was immovable as that of a
statue, his two black eyes remained fixedly regarding
us, and even when his bearded mouth relaxed into a
grim smile, one-half of his face remained unmoved.
He seemed calm and pale in the white moon-light&mdash;but
the cicatrised wound which traversed his cheek
was of a deep and dusky red.
</p>

<p>
"Well, señor," said I, briskly, "are you fully
prepared to answer for the attack you have made
upon us?"
</p>

<p>
"Answer," he reiterated, with something between a
frown and disdainful smile; "to whom?"
</p>

<p>
"The captain general of Andalusia."
</p>

<p>
"I have so many things to answer for already to
that illustrious Caballero of Seville, that he will
be very apt to forget your little affair among others."
</p>

<p>
"But the Governor of Her Brittanic Majesty's
garrison at Gibraltar will refresh both his memory
and yours, rascal!" said poor Slingsby, whose face
was streaming with blood.
</p>

<p>
"Stuff, señores.  Our Lady Donna Isabella II. alone
is Queen of Gibraltar, whatever you may believe
to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
"Then there is our ambassador at Madrid," said I,
swelling with passion.
</p>

<p>
"Let the Señor Embajador come hither to seek
you, if he chooses," replied Fabrique, with a scowl,
while his band made the wooded hollow ring with
their laughter.
</p>

<p>
"For what reason, and with what purpose, is this
outrage committed upon us?" asked Jack, more
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"The reason is here," said Fabrique, throwing
up a heavy purse.  "From the noble Don Joaquim,
Major in the service of the young king Don Pedro
V., I have received one thousand duros to intercept
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"To avenge his brother's death."
</p>

<p>
"In what manner?"
</p>

<p>
"By taking your lives, that is all; blood for blood,
you know; an eye for an eye, a limb for a limb, and
a life for a life, are law and justice all the world over.
If my friend the blind abagado of Jaen were here,
he could not explain the law better."
</p>

<p>
Zumalacarregui, when giving a light from his own
cigar to the Carlist prisoners he was just about to
shoot, could not have spoken more coolly.
</p>

<p>
"And so, fellow, you have received a thousand
duros to murder us?" said Jack, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"One thousand, señor," was the quiet reply.
</p>

<p>
"Conduct us to the harbour of San Lucar, and I
will give you my word of honour that two thousand
shall be sent to you."
</p>

<p>
"You would not break your plighted word?"
</p>

<p>
"I would rather die!"
</p>

<p>
"Then bear in mind that I have pledged mine;
and that I also would rather die than break it.  No,
señores; all the gold in Madrid would not save you."
</p>

<p>
After a pause,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How came you to discover us so readily on this
road?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Easily.  I had spies planted at every gate of
Seville.  A Franciscan begged alms of you at the
Puerto of the San Lucar road."
</p>

<p>
"To whom I gave a peseta."
</p>

<p>
"'T was I."
</p>

<p>
"You!  I wish that I had recognised you then."
</p>

<p>
"Muchos gratias, señor&mdash;my own mother would
not have known me.  I took care of that, and now I
shall take care of you."
</p>

<p>
"It is incredible that a companion so jovial as the
Major de Lucena could contemplate this intended
atrocity," exclaimed Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"Have you not his sister's letter here?" asked
Fabrique, displaying that little document, of which
his searchers had deprived me; "you Inglesos would
doubt the holy face of Jaen, even if it were placed
before you!  I received a thousand dollars to shoot
you down like dogs or wild pigs, and here we are
chattering away like so many magpies.  Vamos
alla&mdash;to the mountains&mdash;cammarados, basta!"
</p>

<p>
"We are not, then, to be shot?" I asked, as a
gleam of hope brightened before me.
</p>

<p>
"No," said he, with an icy smile, as his dark fierce
face came close to mine, like that of a handsome
spectre in the moonlight and as the whole band
began to move; "we will give you to drink of the
Rio de Muerte."
</p>

<p>
The River of Death!&mdash;our blood ran cold at these
words; but no time was left us for expostulation, as
we were hurried up the hills, over wild and furzy
banks, where the laurel, the vine, and the fair yellow
paunch of the gourd grew together in luxuriance;
and among rocks, where the nimble goat browsed,
and the untamed porker flew before us, squeaking
from his lair, among the aromatic plants, the long
reedy grass, the giant fern, and the broad-leaved dock.
Up, up we went, alternately clambering, or being
pushed and dragged, until we gained the brow of a
steep hill, from which we saw beneath us in the
broad, clear, liquid moonlight, the waters of the
Guadalquiver winding away between groves of the
orange and the olive, to San Lucar, and in the
middle distance, but far down below us, the white
houses of Trohniona clustered round their little
church.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
PEDRO THE CONTRABANDISTA.
</h3>

<p>
After a painful and anxious hour elapsed, and we
had traversed about two miles of a steep and craggy
ascent, until we reached a part of the mountain
range which was entirely covered by a little forest of
laurels.  Above us, in the dark blue sky, the moon
was hanging like a large silver globe, and the flood of
clear cold light it diffused over the distant landscape
enabled us to distinguish objects with great
minuteness.  Thus I could trace the gleaming course of the
Guadalquiver, as it wound down from Seville past
Borminos, the mouth of the Guadamar, and the hills
that overhang Dos Hermanos; while other sierras in
the distance undulated afar off, like the waves of a
petrified sea, if such a simile may be allowed me.
Light glinted at times upon the river.  It came from
a passing steamer.  Down there in the valley was the
civilisation of our own time; yet we were about to
perish by the hands of outlaws, whose bearing and
character were worthy of the middle ages, or the
mistier time that lies beyond them.
</p>

<p>
Jack Slingsby and I had scarcely spoken during
our steep and rapid clamber, but our thoughts were
the same; anxiety&mdash;intense anxiety&mdash;for our fate;
repugnance for our captors, and a natural horror
of dying a barbarous death at their hands, on these
remote and lonely mountains; far from help, far
from justice and from civilisation; a death, of which
our friends, our relations, and our comrades would
never hear&mdash;would never know; for our fate would
become a mystery, which all the captains general, the
ambassadors, the chargés des affaires, and even the
correspondents of the "Times" would be unable to
clear up or unravel,&mdash;as it was the purpose of these
wretches, whose prey we had become, to hide for
ever our remains, and the very means of our death,
as completely as if we had been flung into Mount
Etna.
</p>

<p>
In this sequestered part of the mountain chain,
hidden among the thickly-twined laurels, the wild
and straggling vines, and the densely-matted jungle
of gourds, and other luxuriant creepers, there
suddenly yawned a chasm in the granite rocks&mdash;a black
profundity of unknown depth.  The gaping rent was
about twenty feet broad by some hundred in length,
but its mouth was greatly diminished by the bordering
foliage and wild plants that overhung it.  Far down,
perhaps five hundred feet below (for the bottom was
unseen), there rolled with a deep, hoarse, roaring
sound the Rio de Muerte&mdash;the River of Death&mdash;a
subterranean tributary of the Guadalquiver; and its
strange and hollow voice as it gurgled, surged, and
bellowed through the clefts and fissures in the heart
of the mountains, filled me with a pang of horror.
Here we paused, and our captors muttered one to
another under their thick beards, smoked their paper
cigaritos, and leaned leisurely on their short
escapetas, or long-barrelled muskets, and seemed to await
the approach of Fabrique de Urquija, who was some
yards behind us, and came up very much at his ease.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said my friend, "if it be their
purpose to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To throw us down there, you would say?  My
dear Slingsby, such seems indeed to be their
dreadful purpose, and I see here but little hope of
mercy or of charity, where bribes greater than those
of that infamous major have failed before a savage
idea of honour and the fulfilment of a villanous trust."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven help us!"
</p>

<p>
"If these are not your prayers, señores," said one
fellow in Spanish, with a slight Murcian accent,
"you had better betake yourselves to them, for in
less than ten minutes you will be at the bottom of
this terrible place, and be swept through the bowels
of the mountain towards the Guadalquiver."
</p>

<p>
The man spoke gently and with some emotion; it
was evident that his dreadful life had not yet
obliterated every remnant of civilisation and humanity.
There was, moreover, something terribly impressive
in his words, when heard amid the hoarse rush of
that deep and subterranean torrent, whose waters
came we knew not from where, and traversed depths
and caverns, of which we could have no conception,
in their way to the valley below.
</p>

<p>
There was a refined cruelty in bringing us to such
a place, and to die such a death; for the mind
"shrunk back upon itself and trembled," when
contemplating the dark profundity through which this
mysterious torrent poured.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, good señores, pray," said this man, kindly
again, as he touched me on the shoulder, "down
upon your knees, for here comes the capitano, and
he never tarries with his prisoners on the brink
of the Rio de Muerte, or the Cima de Cabra."
</p>

<p>
"What does the fellow say?" asked poor Slingsby,
who looked a little pale, and whose nether lip was
tightly clenched.
</p>

<p>
"He bids us lose no time, but to pray."
</p>

<p>
"Pray!" reiterated Jack, fiercely; "I pray to
Heaven only that my hands were loose for one
moment, that I might strike a blow for life or for
revenge."
</p>

<p>
"Threats are absurd, señor," said Fabrique de
Urquija, throwing the end of his cigar with perfect
deliberation into the chasm that yawned before us:
"and bribes are alike useless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can it be, brave Spaniards," said I, becoming
desperate, and encouraged by the evident sympathy
of one to endeavour to soften the rest; "can it be
that you will prove so cruel and so merciless to two
unoffending strangers, who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, señores!" exclaimed Fabrique, in a voice
of thunder, while drawing a pistol from his belt;
"in attempting to tamper with my followers you but
anticipate your fate.  Iago Pineda&mdash;Stephano el
Corcovado, over with them! dost thou hear me? presto! or
by the mother of God, this bullet shall see
the brains of some of you."
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth; his eyes shot fire, and his
broad nostrils seemed to dilate as he gave this savage
order.
</p>

<p>
Stephano the humpbacked, and the other who
was named Iago Pineda, and who was no other than
our sympathetic friend, threw down their escopetas
and grasped me.  They were powerful and muscular
men&mdash;aye, men of iron frames and iron hearts, and
a sickening emotion rose within me as their hands
were roughly laid upon my pinioned arms.  The
moonlit mountains and the far-stretching Vega swam
around me; the forms of our murderers were multiplied
a thousandfold; the perspiration fell heavily
from my brow, and a half-arrested cry to Heaven for
that pity which men denied us here, arose to my lips
as they were about to hurl me downward; when, lo!
Pineda paused, looked back, and listening,
relinquished my right arm.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think, do you dare to disobey?" cried
Fabrique, as he levelled a brass-barrelled pistol full
at his head; "to work at once, vile mutineer, or por
vida del demonic&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold&mdash;para&mdash;detenedos!" cried a breathless
voice, and a man mounted on horseback, and armed
with a long gun, dashed his jennet at full speed
through the laurel bushes into the midst of the free
company.
</p>

<p>
"Who cries hold?" demanded Fabrique, almost
choking with passion, while turning his pistol against
the intruder; and all his people cocked or clubbed
their muskets in high alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I do&mdash;I, your brother Pedro the contrabandista."
</p>

<p>
"Oho, and what seek you here?"
</p>

<p>
"The safety of these two Caballeros, who at
Gibraltar saved me from the guarda costa of Hernan
de Lucena in the first place, and from the chain and
the scourge in Her Majesty's galleys in the second
place."
</p>

<p>
"How! was it you, brother Pedro, whose felucca
was concerned in this business?" asked Fabrique,
with an altered voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Fabrique, it was my little craft, La Buena
Fortuna, which the Lieutenant De Lucena pursued
till a shot from the Mole fort shortened him by two
feet.  I claim their lives, for they are my friends
and patrons, and would have supped with me to-night
at Trohniona had not your devilish fellows
came upon us like a herd of wild cats, just when I
was kicking and cuffing yonder rascally raterillo, who
has made off with all my dollars.  So I fled from the
wayside-well, for I knew not whose free company
your lads had the honour to be, and feared they
might relieve me alike of life and all care for my
packages."
</p>

<p>
Jack and I now began to breathe a little more
freely; for as all this took place in less time than I
have taken to write it, there was some difficulty in
realising the conviction that we had been waylaid,
doomed to death and saved, with such rapidity: yet
so it was, and so ended the scene of that night to
which I can never recur without a chill of awe and
horror, blended with a very decided sensation of
anger and just indignation.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the alleged solemnity with which
his word was plighted to the malevolent major of the
sainted regiment of Lagos, "in the kingdom of
Algarve," Fabrique relinquished his cruel purpose,
unbound us at his brother's request, and restored to
us our arms, horses, and little baggage&mdash;everything,
in short, not even excepting the letter of poor
Paulina.  He gave us cigars, a hearty quaff from his bota,
and then a bow so low that his black velvet sombrero
almost swept the dewy sward.  He then drew off
with all his band towards the Sierra de Honda, and
in two hours afterwards we were comfortably seated
by the kitchen fire in the posada of Trohniona, at
supper with his brother the contrabandista, who was
en route for San Lucar.
</p>

<p>
For some time after, throughout the night in which
these startling events occurred, in fancy I saw before
me the cold, stern visage and fierce glaring eyes of
Urquija, and above all other sounds I seemed to hear
the deep hoarse rush of the subterranean Rio de
Muerte.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE SPANISH STEAMER.
</h3>

<p>
Whatever may have been the emotions with which
we regarded the formidable relative of our contrabandista,
we spared him the humiliation of listening
to the just appreciation we had of the character of
Fabrique; and enlivened by those songs and stories
with which the honest fellow endeavoured to raise
our spirits and efface the terrible recollection of that
hour upon the hills of Trohniona, we supped upon a
guisado and bottle of valdepenas.
</p>

<p>
Now I may inform the uninitiated that the aforesaid
guisado was a stew, such as can only be made in
a real Spanish pipkin.  It consisted of two chickens,
a plump partridge, and a hare, well seasoned with oil,
garlic, pepper, and saffron all simmered together
When hot and steaming, the giblets, &amp;c., are fished
up from the depths of the savoury pipkin, with just
such a wooden spoon as paunchy Sancho used, when
diving therewith into his beloved flesh-pots at the
wedding of Camacho.
</p>

<p>
Supper over, and a fresh bota ordered, Pedro
assumed his guitar, and while we cleaned and examined
our swords and pistols, and all the people of the
posada, the patron and patrona, the waiteresses, the
stabler, and the little half-naked muchaco who cleaned
the boots and turned the spit, crowded near, he, the
jovial contrabandista, turned his dark eyes and
well-bearded visage towards the dusky wooden ceiling,
and while his swarthy cheek glowed in the light of
the kitchen fire, struck up one of those lively seguidillas
which are the delight of the Spaniards, and skilfully
he brushed the strings with his finger-points in
a manner which I believe is peculiar to the Andalusians.
</p>

<p>
A very amorous love ditty succeeded, and when
the roguish eyes of Pedro wandered knowingly from
one person to another, the patrona blushed with
pleasure, and all the waiteresses simpered and spread out
their short but full-flounced skirts, or displayed their
handsome red stockings, to let their well-shaped legs
be seen, as well as their pretty zapatas; for the roving
and romantic contrabandista, whose habits are so
full of life and energy, is ever a welcome guest at the
wayside inns of Spain, and to none more than their
fairer inmates.
</p>

<p>
Now Pedro's gaudy brown jacket, all covered with
silver bell-buttons, bright silken lace, and spangles;
his ample breeches of gay velveteen; his brilliant
sash and broad hat placed a little over the right eye,
made him a welcome visitor to all the women, while
the stories, news, or fibs which his incessant
perambulations afforded him ample means of collecting,
made him equally acceptable to the men; thus, like
other bold contrabandistas, who by sea and land set
the laws of the Cortes at defiance, Pedro was always
sure of the brightest smiles, the oldest wine in the
cellar, the best fowl in the larder, the warmest corner
by the kitchen fire, and the most snug cama in the
posada, while pretty hands stroked his docile jennet,
and readier ones removed his corded packages, and
placed his guitar and loaded gun by his bedside for
the night.
</p>

<p>
Pedro's songs, and the stories he told during the
single night we spent with him, would fill a volume;
but the time passed rapidly away; we were up
betimes, mounted and armed to ride; and with
something of real satisfaction, Jack and I turned our
backs on those hated mountains, where a thicket of
green laurels, diminished to a black speck by the
distance, indicated the locality of the Rio de Muerte.
</p>

<p>
Trotting pleasantly, we passed Isla-mayor, which
lies about twelve miles from the mouth of the
Guadalquiver, and abounds in fruit-trees, which were
then in full blossom.
</p>

<p>
By this time, Paulina, her dark eyes, and her
witchery were alike forgotten, and her little note on
pink paper had been smoked away in cigaritos.  The
keen interest taken in our affairs by the major had
completely cured me; so much for Spanish romance
contrasted with Spanish reality.
</p>

<p>
"And you have decided on taking the steamer at
San Lucar, señores?" said Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and happy shall we be to find ourselves safe
on board of her," said I; "we have had too many
devilish scrapes among you Spaniards to wish for
more travelling in the saddle.  It is no joke to escape
being hanged as a spy by a blundering alcalde one
day, and a terrible death the next by drowning, at
the hands of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My brother Fabrique," said he, good-humouredly,
closing a sentence, the termination of which might
have proved unpleasant.  "Well, señores, my little
felucca the 'Buena Fortuna'&mdash;you know her, with
her long brass gun and lateen sails&mdash;is lying
concealed in a solitary creek near Carbonera.  I have
run her in there, because a fleet&mdash;yes, maldito&mdash;a
whole fleet of guarda costas are at anchor in the
harbour of San Lucar; but we must put to sea
to-morrow night, and if you will so far honour me,
Caballeros, as to accept a passage with me to
Gibraltar, the best valdepenas and the noblest Xeres
that ever came out of a madre-butt shall be at your
service.  Ah, you shake your head, Señor Don
Ricardo, and think you have had enough of me and
my poor little craft&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Right, Pedro, and wish to have no more affairs with
a guarda costa," said Slingsby; "besides, if you were
attacked and taken at sea, after a fight, you would
fight, of course&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To the death, Señor, guerra al cuchillo, as the
old guerillas say."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;what would be our fate?"
</p>

<p>
"True, señor.  If not killed, you would be sent to
the galleys at Barcelona, and so might as well have
taken a dip in the Rio de Muerte.  Well, I will cease
to urge you.  Here is the gate of Bonanza, which
may be termed the port of Seville, though the city is
fifteen leagues distant; yonder is its castle, with the
Spanish flag flying, and here is the quay, where all
large vessels laden with goods discharge their cargoes,
as the shallowness of the Guadalquiver will not permit
them to ascend higher&mdash;you understand, señores?"
</p>

<p>
Here at this small town we bade farewell to Pedro,
who promised to visit us as soon as he came round to
Gibraltar; and pushing on, after a trot of a mile or
two over a dreary and sandy waste, we found
ourselves amid the sunny and bustling streets of San
Lucar de Barameda, where we sought at once its
harbour, the quays of which were, as usual, piled
chin deep with boxes of oranges, of raisins, and of
prunes, casks of salt, of wine, and of brandy; while
the flags of all nations&mdash;the stars and stripes of North
America, the eagles and tricolours of the South, the
union jack and the crosses of Scandinavia&mdash;were
waving among a forest of masts; in short, we found
ourselves amid all the noise and lively stir of a
Spanish seaport, where the splash of the screw
propeller furrowed the waters of the Guadalquiver, and
the steam, as it escaped at times, was like music to
us, who had just eluded the fangs of Fabrique's
mountain wolves.
</p>

<p>
We soon found the boat for Gibraltar, "Neustra
Señora de Assistencia," and embarked ourselves and
our horses, which were taken on board in stalls, that
were slung from a whip at the yard-arm; and in an
hour after, muffled in our cloaks, with choice cubas to
solace us, we lounged on the paddle gangway as the
vessel steamed out of the harbour between the two
castles of San Lucar&mdash;the same fortresses which
saluted the little fleet of Columbus, when departing
in search of a western world&mdash;and passed the
roadstead and the dangerous entrance, where the wild
waves are ever beating in tumult; and thus we left
the port enveloped in a golden haze and diminishing
astern, as the sun set behind the mountain peaks of
Seville.
</p>

<p>
The bay of Cadiz soon opened on our larboard
bow, and the city itself, with all its lights and spires,
and then the Isla de Leon arose before us, white and
glimmering in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
The silver waves seemed to toy with the golden
sand, as their coy riplets chafed the beach; but in
other places the moonlit sea dashed its spray like
showers of diamonds and prisms against the abutting
rocks.
</p>

<p>
Overhead, the dark blue sky was clear and cloudless,
save where a long black pennon of wavy smoke
streamed far astern from the glowing funnel of "Our
Lady of Assistance," and all was still save the
ceaseless and monotonous dashing of the paddle-wheels,
and the measured clank of the engines, as we ploughed
along the lovely Spanish shore, and towards midnight
saw that point of land on which no Briton can gaze
without an emotion of pride, the Cape of Trafalgar.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE CIRCASSIAN CAPTAIN.
</h3>

<p>
On board the steamer our attention had been
repeatedly attracted, and our interest&mdash;mine, at
least&mdash;excited by a fellow-passenger, whose manner,
costume, and bearing were too remarkable to escape notice.
</p>

<p>
His figure was tall and handsomely formed; his
features, pale and like marble, were cast in the most
pure and severe model of classic beauty; his nose
was long and straight; his black eye-brows nearly met
over it in one unbroken line; a fierce mustache stuck
out on each side, giving great expression to a mouth,
the lips of which were generally compressed, and in
expression stern.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, his face had in it more of pure intellect
and pictorial manly beauty than any I had ever seen.
His costume was a scarlet forage cap, the tassel of
which drooped on his right shoulder, and a loose
tunic of dark green cloth, the cuffs, collar, and skirts
of which were trimmed with sables; but this peculiar
garment, like his long military boots, seemed well
worn, or as Jack said, "decidedly shabby."
</p>

<p>
He remained very much aloof from the passengers,
and either sat or walked apart, communing apparently
with himself, and smoking a huge pipe, the aspect of
which was as foreign as his own.
</p>

<p>
A figure so melo-dramatic on board of a steamer&mdash;even
a Spanish one&mdash;was too remarkable in the present
day to escape notice, and I repeatedly drew Slingsby's
attention to him; but honest Jack had not quite
recovered the effect of the start given him last night on
the hills of Trohniona, and replied briefly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"An interesting foreigner, eh! that will sound very
well to the ears of a novel-reading miss at home; but
such personages excite a very different feeling in me.
A seedy sharper!  I am sick, Ramble, of your interesting
foreigners; they are invariably swindlers, refugees,
and all that sort of thing, unless we except the poor
monkeys in the Zoological gardens," and so Jack
assumed a sulky air of reserve, while our voyager in
the furs and long boots smoked his huge meerschaum
to leeward, and all unconscious that he was an object
of remark or interest to any one.
</p>

<p>
On visiting our horses in the stalls, we found that
our fellow-traveller had also a nag, and that this
animal seemed the object of all his cares; for he was
by its side almost every half hour, stroking its sleek
coat and slender legs; tickling its square nostrils and
pointed ears, or wiping its fine liquid eyes with his
white handkerchief, and feeding it from the palm of
his hands, which were white and muscular, while he
spoke caressingly in a barbarous language, which the
horse&mdash;a noble Arab-steed, with a magnificent head,
and limbs as slender as a girl's wrist&mdash;seemed to
understand.  There was something so peculiar in all this,
and especially in the man's strong and tender regard
for his horse, that Slingsby's John Bullism began to
relax, for the proverbial crustiness of his country
little became a frank fellow like him; so he ventured
a few remarks in English on horses in general, and
this fine barb in particular.
</p>

<p>
The foreigner shook his head, and smiled pleasantly,
as he articulated with difficulty that he scarcely knew
a word of English; whereupon Jack turned his remarks
into very choice Spanish.
</p>

<p>
Again the stranger smiled and bowed, showing under
his close and thick mustache that he had a set of
teeth our brightest belles might envy, as he said in
the language of our allies,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, sir, but I speak only French
with my native language; and it maybe a little&mdash;Russ."
</p>

<p>
"Russ&mdash;indeed!" said I, with fresh interest; "are
you a Cossack?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said he, with a sudden air of haughty reserve,
"do I look like one?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say," said Jack, "as I never saw one."
</p>

<p>
He was about to withdraw, as if our notice was
displeasing to him, when it chanced that a puff of wind
opened my cloak, and below it he perceived the
scarlet shell jacket, which was the undress of "Ours."  Then
his bold dark eye lighted up with new animation,
and raising his forage cap, he said, smilingly, in
French, which he spoke with great fluency and a good
accent,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Officers, I perceive, and, better than all, British
officers!  Would that I had known this sooner, we
might have had a pleasant evening together; but now
our voyage is nearly half over, as the captain has just
told me.  I am so glad to meet you, gentlemen, for I,
too, have had the honour to wear a sword."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask in what service?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"The Russian, latterly."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"You are surprised," he said, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Rather."
</p>

<p>
"It was the result of fate, or rather the fortune of
war, that placed me in their ranks.  I was taken in
battle, and had no alternative but to serve in the
imperial cavalry, or drag a chain over the snows of
Siberia; and thus I accepted the former, resolving to
escape to my own dear mountains on the first
opportunity.  I am a Circassian, and fought under the
heroic Schamyl, though latterly I held the rank of
captain in the Tenginski hussars; but tyranny and
misfortune drove me from the Russian ranks before a
proper opportunity for escape had come; and I have
wandered over many lands with no companion save
my horse&mdash;my dear Zupi," he continued, caressing the
Arab, which rubbed its fine head upon his cheek, as if
understanding the reference its master had just made;
"my beloved Zupi, who has shared with me many a
day of peril, and has thrice saved my life from
Russian bullets and from drowning; for there is no horse
like thee, Zupi, between the Kuban and the Caspian
Sea."
</p>

<p>
"He is quite a Mazeppa, this," said Jack, in English.
</p>

<p>
"And you are now going to Gibraltar?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, gentlemen; but I merely make a visit there,
and at Malta, on my way home through Turkey; as
I have a letter of introduction to an officer of your
garrison."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask his name?"
</p>

<p>
"It is here: John Slingsby, Esq., Lieutenant,
H.M. &mdash;th Foot&mdash;perhaps you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"The deuce!  It is for me; I am Slingsby of
the &mdash;th," said Jack, in astonishment, for he was
puzzled to remember what friends he had among the
Tenginski hussars, or on the shores of the Caspian Sea;
"devilish odd, sir!  I really don't know any one in
Circassia, or any one who ever was there, or likely to
be so."
</p>

<p>
"I received this letter in London," said the stranger,
with a soft smile; "at a clubhouse of the Guards, for
the officers of the Household Brigade were more than
kind; being, indeed, as fathers to me, and treating me
as if I had been their own son, instead of what I
am&mdash;a poor waif, floating on the current of events."
</p>

<p>
"I am the man," said Jack, tearing open the letter
which the Circassian produced from his breast-pocket,
and delivered; but with the slightest possible shade
of anxiety on his fine but saddened face.  Poor
fellow! he had doubtless been so often deceived and
misused, that he was learning to mistrust every one,
and his eyes were riveted on the face of Slingsby,
who suddenly shook him by the hand, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"This meeting is most remarkable; your letter
of introduction to me and to our mess is from my
brother."
</p>

<p>
"Bismillah, is it possible!"
</p>

<p>
"From my brother, Sir Harry Slingsby, of the
Grenadier Guards.  I am most happy to meet you,
Captain Rioni, and with my friend, Captain Ramble
of "Ours," will do all in my power to assist you."
</p>

<p>
Jack handed his brother's letter to me.  It ran
thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR JACK,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Allow me to introduce to you and to your
brother officers of the old &mdash;th Captain Osman Rioni
(late of the&mdash;I am sorry to say it&mdash;Russian service),
who has been for some time in London teaching our
Life Guards the lance exercise, and who for the last
three months has been the lion of the club-houses.  He
arrived among us a staid and respectable Mohammedan,
very prone to sit cross-legged on the floor, to dip
his fingers in the gravy, and to grasp his knife if you
gave him a slice of ham with his fowl; but he leaves us
much addicted to balls, vingt un, champagne suppers,
the polka, and the waltz.  In short, in one season, we
have polished him up in good style, and completed
an education which had been somewhat neglected
during his rural life among the Caucasus.  You,
perhaps, know the history of himself and his horse&mdash;for
the morning papers get hold of everything.  Conyers
of the Blues offered him £500 for the nag; but he
won't sell it for any known amount of the ready.
Look at its legs and chest; I never saw such an
animal!  The captain has been an honorary member
of our mess while in London&mdash;a hint this, for your
fellows.  He is now on his way home to the Kuban
(wherever the devil that may be), and so you gentlemen
of the Line in Gibraltar must look to the state
of his exchequer, and pass him on to the next station,
as Conyers has given him letters to some of the Rifles
at Malta.  I could easily have procured him a troop
in our new Turkish contingent; but home he must
and shall go, he says, and his own story will best let
you know why.  To-morrow our battalion will change
its quarters, and commence the arduous march from
St. John's Wood Barracks to those in Portman-street,
and from thence to Trafalgar-square, and I shall
follow in my cab; but you may see me ere long, for I
am to sail with the next draught of ours for the
Crimea, where the shiny splendour will be taken out
of our Brahmins in the muddy trenches&mdash;ugh!  Give
my remembrance to Dick Ramble&mdash;ask him what his
next book is to be about; and so, my dear Jack,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I remain, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The wishes of Sir Henry, and the efforts he and
his brother officers of the Grenadier Guards (most of
whom will remember the affair I allude to) made it
imperative upon "Ours" not to be behind them in
kindness to this stranger.
</p>

<p>
Jack and I promised to leave nothing undone to
serve him on our arrival at Gibraltar, and assured him
that we would see sufficient funds raised to send him
either to Malta, or by steamer straight to
Constantinople.  His ignorance of English and Spanish had
sadly puzzled the brain of our poor Circassian, who
had landed with his horse and baggage at San Lucar,
believing it to be Gibraltar, and had thus lost several
days, and, what was of more consequence, much of
his money; so that his mind was full of anxiety as
to the future, and how his horse&mdash;his Zupi&mdash;for they
seemed one, like a centaur, were to reach that mighty
mountain range that lies between the Euxine and the
Cape of Alpcheron; and which, with all its black
forests, wild rocks, and snowy peaks was his beloved
home; the altar of oriental independence&mdash;the
barrier of the Eastern world against the encroaching
Kuos.
</p>

<p>
We supped together in the cabin; and while the
Spanish passengers were all smoking or asleep on
the benches and lockers, we prevailed upon the
Circassian, over a bottle of good wine, to inform us how
he came to serve in the Russian cavalry, and why
he declined Sir Harry's apparently advantageous offer
of a Captain's commission in our Turkish contingent&mdash;a
service for which he seemed so admirably fitted,
and in which he might have won honour and distinction;
at least such distinction as John Bull awards
to those who are not on the staff, and have no
ministerial interest.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head sadly, as I said something
to this purpose, and bowing, gave me a pleasant
smile.
</p>

<p>
"When you have heard me, you will understand
more fully that the only place for me is my native
land&mdash;that home which is now so far off, that when I
trace upon a map the extent of sea and shore that lie
between its hills and me, my heart grows faint and
sick; but patience yet awhile, and one day I shall
stand again an the black rugged mountains of Kushaa,
and see at my feet far down below, the fertile plains of
Georgia and Mingrelia.  Zupi will snuff the pure
air of these Alpine peaks, and toss his proud mane
on the wind; strong warriors, in their shirts of mail,
will be riding by my side; the Albanian musket and
the Tartar bow will be there, as we survey the long
dark lines that mark upon the green summer fields,
or it may be the winter snow, the columns of the
Russian Emperor&mdash;columns that advance but to
defeat and death; for in thousands, yea, hundreds of
thousands, have they come to war against us, and to
perish on the Circassian hills, until the very soil has
been drenched in their blood, and fattened by the
bones of men and horses!  But my emotions carry
me away, gentlemen, and I am forgetting my own
story."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;yes, the story," said Jack, refilling the
stranger's glass, and pushing the decanters towards
me, while our new friend began, as nearly as I can
remember, in the following words.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
OSMAN RIONI
</h3>

<p>
Bismillah! there is but one God, and Mohammed is
His prophet; and on earth He is the powerful hand
of Him who moveth the stars, who giveth light to the
sun, and throweth darkness on the souls of the
Russian unbelievers.
</p>

<p>
I am a Circassian, and, consequently, a Mohammedan,
being a native of those districts of the Caucasus
which have waged a ceaseless war with Russia&mdash;I
mean that portion of our mountains which lies
between Tamrook and the strong fortress of Anapa,
whose ramparts are washed by the waves of the
Euxine Sea.  We are all soldiers from our birth; thus,
out of a population of three hundred thousand souls,
our tribe can at any time muster fifty thousand
warriors, well mounted on fleet Caucasian horses, and
well armed, after our own fashion, in coats of mail,
with musket, bow and pistol, sabre, dagger, and
cartridge box; men, brave and handsome, and stubborn
as their native rocks&mdash;men to whom danger is a
pastime, and death but the door to Paradise.
</p>

<p>
Thus the mountaineers of the Caucasus, though
mustering only about two millions of souls, have
never stooped before a conqueror; but, in the face of
all the world, have hurled back the legions of the
Russian Empire, and maintained against it a struggle
for fifty years&mdash;a struggle which, when our valour and
disparity of numbers on one side are contrasted with
the ferocity and overwhelming force on the other,
has no parallel in the history of the modern world.
The Russians name us the Tcherkesses, which means
literally "those who bar the way;" for never did
a foreign host leave their cursed foot-prints, on the
summits of the Caucasus.
</p>

<p>
Our mountains have become the ramparts of
Turkey and of Persia, as our Declaration of
Independence asserts; but they will become&mdash;unless we
are supported by Western Europe&mdash;the avenue to
both!  We voluntarily submitted to the khans of the
Crimea, and afterwards to the sultans of Constantinople;
but, alas! we have lost the chiefs, whose
banners could have summoned a hundred thousand
warriors; yet now are we all, as one man, united in a
deep and undying hatred of Russia!  She has built
forts on our territory, but dare her soldiers venture
a foot beyond their cannon?  In short, sirs, Circassia
is free and independent; for neither the lying
maps of Russia, which are spread throughout the
world, and which mark the Caucasus as her territory,
nor words, nor arts can enslave us.  Arms may do
it, but the steel has never yet been forged, nor the
cannon cast, that will make the proud Circassian
stoop his crest before the barbarous Russ!
Bismillah!  The wild Tcherkesses are still free as the
stormy wind that sweeps from Azov down the
Euxine.
</p>

<p>
My father Mostapha was a chief; the head of one
of those princely houses which are of Kabardian
descent; his will was a law to his people; and the
booty he took in his wars with the fierce Tartars and
faithless Muscovites was the reward of their fidelity.
We were Christians once&mdash;many ages ago&mdash;but it
pleased God to open our eyes to the blessed precepts
of Islam, and now we turn our faces to the Kaaba
when we pray.  Many nobles followed the banner of
my father, whose territories extended along the base
of the mountain steppes, from Marinskoi to the banks
of the Kisselbash River; but one night, in the year
1807, the Russian General Goudivitch, with ten
thousand cavalry, burst among us; stormed Anapa,
and gave our men to the sword, our roofs to the
flames, and our children to the wolf and the eagle.
</p>

<p>
My father fought long and nobly; the war was
desperate; the Russians impaled their prisoners, and
my father roasted his; but the tide of battle turned
against us.  All our possessions became a prey to the
Russ, and our most beautiful damsels were given as
wives or handmaidens to those brutal Cossacks,
whom the merciless Goudivitch had brought from the
banks of the Don.  Azrael spread his dusky wings
over our beautiful country; all the land was burned
up, and black as night&mdash;being waste as a garden
whose fruits have been gathered.
</p>

<p>
Then the new chain of forts was built along the
Kuban.  These marked the extended boundary of
the Russian territory, and the land of my father was
lost for ever; his bones lay unburied, where he had
fallen, sword in hand, on the threshold of his own
door, pierced by the same bayonets that slew his
faithful wife; and their three children, myself and
two brothers, sole heirs to his hopes and his harvest
of vengeance, received the bread of charity from
another Circassian tribe, the friendly Abassians, who
dwell between the mountains and the Euxine.
</p>

<p>
Time rolled on, and from tending the flocks of the
Abassians as shepherd boys, my brothers Selim and
Karolyi grew strong and hardy men.  The Abassians
told us of our father's fate, and we longed to avenge
it, and to recover our lost patrimony.  Day after day
we spent our time in acquiring the perfect use
of arms, in talking of our hopes, our projects, and
desires; and often we looked with kindling eyes
towards those mountains, from whose summits the
Muscovite outposts were visible by the waters of the
Kuban; for dear as war and vengeance are the honour
of his race and country to the proud and free
Tcherkesse.
</p>

<p>
We could soon ride the wildest Arab steeds, and
gallop them without bridle or saddle along giddy
rocks, and through the untrodden forest.  None surpassed
us in the use of the sabre, the poniard, or the
pistol; few equalled Selim in handling the heavy
Albanian musket; while Karolyi was matchless in the
use of the Circassian sling; and in my hands, the
bow was as unerring as the best Frankish rifle.  I
was older than my brave brothers by a few years, and
thus became, in somewise, their preceptor.  We were
poor, but ardent and full of enthusiasm; we worked,
begged, and bartered&mdash;we were never satisfied until
each of us was possessor of a fleet and active barb,
a bright steel coat of mail; a helmet of tempered iron,
such as our warriors wear, and which covers all the face,
except the eyes and nose; a curved sabre of keen
Damascus steel; an Albanian musket; breast cases
to receive our cartridges; a sharp Circassian dagger,
and a Tartar bow: and when thus accoutred, our
hearts would swell with fierce emotion, as we reined
up our steeds upon the hills above Anapa, and shook
our lances in defiance at the Russian steamers and
frigates in the Euxine, while we longed for the time
when the war-cry of Islam would ring among the
hills, and we should behold the Sangiac Sheerif, the
green banner of our confederated princes, with its
three golden arrows and twelve white stars, unfurled
against the barbarous Emperor Nicholas Romanoff.
</p>

<p>
We loved each other strongly, dearly, and devotedly,
my two brothers and I, for we were alone in the world,
the last of all our race.  Being the eldest, they
frequently importuned me to marry, that I might have
children, and perpetuate our family; but I told them
to remember that it was the custom of our people for
a prince to wed the daughter of a prince; a noble to
wed the daughter of a noble; a tocar to wed the
daughter of a tocar; and the poor serf to wed the
daughter of a serf.  That I was neither prince nor
tocar, noble nor serf, and could not marry, being too
poor to wed one in the rank of my father, and too
proud to stoop to a maiden beneath it.  "Besides,"
I told them, "we have other duties to perform than
espousing wives, which are ever a barrier to freedom
of thought in peace, and bravery of action in war;
for the blessed Prophet said, that wives and children
were barriers to the performance of great deeds.
God knoweth all things, and will direct the heart of
Osman.  I will not marry yet awhile, my brothers;
for it is written that marriage disturbs a man from his
duty&mdash;the wedded care for the things of this world,
even as the unwedded care for those of heaven; and
so we must watch and pray for our country, to defend
her from the infidel Russians, who, like accursed
locusts, blacken all the shores of the Kuban."  Then
my brothers Selim and Karolyi kissed me on both
cheeks, applauding my resolution; and once more
we shook our gauntletted hands in fierce menace
towards the ramparts of Anapa.
</p>

<p>
But ere long there occurred circumstances which
altered my resolution; for before the eyes of a
beautiful woman the strongest heart is weak as
water.
</p>

<p>
One evening I was riding on the mountain slopes
that overlook the waters of the Euxine.  The last
rays of evening were lingering on their peaks, and
shedding a golden tint upon the waves that rolled
away towards the cliffs of the Crimea.  At my feet
lay Sundjik Bay, glittering in the blaze of light that
steeped sea, sky, and shore.  The snow-white walls
of Anapa, which crown rocks a hundred feet in
height, were gleaming in the yellow sunshine, and
grimly the black iron cannon peered through the
stone embrasures, or over the ramparts of
smoothly-shorn grass.
</p>

<p>
The flat-capped Russian sentinels, muffled in their
gray great-coats walked to and fro upon their posts;
and each time they turned I saw their bayonets flash
above the two square towers that guard the great
arched entrance.  Over all was the white flag with
the Muscovite cross, but there was no wind to spread
its folds upon the evening sky, and it hung about the
staff listlessly and still; not a blade of grass stirred
on the mighty plain of the Kuban, which spread far
away towards the north, silent as a land of the dead.
Under my iron helmet, grimly I surveyed Anapa and
the rocks of Taman, and panted for the time when
the standard of the twelve confederated princes of
Circassia would be planted there, and when the
black cross of the God-abandoned Russ would be
torn down and steeped in the blood of its defenders.
</p>

<p>
My heart was full of fierce and fiery thoughts, when
suddenly the cry of a woman, ringing upon the clear
air of the hot summer eve, fell on my ear, and I reined
up my horse&mdash;the same winch I have now on board
with me&mdash;my noble Zuyi, to listen.
</p>

<p>
"Yani, Yani!" cried a despairing voice, which in
our language means "mother, mother!"
</p>

<p>
I spurred Zupi over a hillock, and perceived four
Russian soldiers of the Tenginski infantry, then
garrisoning Anapa, dragging along a Circassian woman,
who made no resistance, but cried piteously for
mercy.
</p>

<p>
Uttering a shout of anger and defiance, I lowered
my lance, and rushed upon them without a moment of
hesitation.
</p>

<p>
They immediately relinquished their prey, who sank
senseless on the ground, while they betook them to
their muskets, crying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Death to the Tcherkesse! down with the unbeliever!"
and all four fired upon me at once; but God,
the common father of all mankind (except the
Russians) protected me.  One bullet tore the plume from
my helmet, another was turned by the fluted pockets
which (in lieu of cartridge boxes) we wear across our
breasts, the others whistled harmlessly past me, and
before one of these soldiers could reload or club his
weapon I was upon them.  The first two I speared,
and hurled to the earth like ripe pumpkins; a third,
I trampled under the hoofs of Zupi; and afterwards
slew at my leisure; the fourth sprung over a ruined
wall and escaped me, but for a few minutes only, as I
pinned him to the earth by an arrow, but he rose and
staggered away.  This man was named Archipp
Osepoff, of whom more anon.
</p>

<p>
I now dismounted, and, throwing the bridle over
the neck of my docile Zupi, approached the insensible
female I had rescued.
</p>

<p>
She was attired in the richest fashion of our Circassian
damsels.  A robe of costly silk open in front,
and confined at her slender waist by a glittering
girdle of silver; trowsers of the finest pink muslin;
and the red slippers on her pretty feet were
embroidered with gold; a turban, composed of the most
delicate shawl, fell in graceful folds over her small
and beautiful neck, and a large veil of lace entwined
with silver, enveloped her whole person, and floated
like a white mist about her.
</p>

<p>
This I dared to draw aside that the air might play
upon her face, and so revive her.  Oh, Mahmoud
resoul allah! the beauty of our women is proverbial,
and as you know, gentlemen, the world acknowledges
it; but how shall I describe the loveliness of this
Circassian damsel, who proved to be the flower of the
Abassian maids?  Her complexion was of the purest
white, the result of excessive delicacy, and perhaps of
that seclusion which was necessary to conceal her from
the prying eyes of the Russian soldiers, or of the
trading Turks; and this paleness of skin, when
contrasted with the blackness of her massive braids of
hair, was almost startling.  Her eyes were also dark,
but beautiful and dove-like in expression, for a
languishing gentleness was in every feature, and over all
her form.  She was but a girl; yet so full, round, and
tall, that for the house of the sultan I had seen many
thousand piastres paid for an odalisque, who was
unfit to kiss even her slipper.  Basilia was among
the most beautiful of our Circassian maids, or, as
Schamyl calls them, the daughters of the rocks and
streams.
</p>

<p>
She soon recovered on perceiving that she was free
and that the protecting arm of a Circassian was
around her; but she tremblingly drew the veil over
her face, as I led her by the hand from the spot where
her late capturers lay dead on the sward, with their
blood congealing beneath them.
</p>

<p>
"It pleased the Prophet to send me to your aid,
fair damsel," said I; "are there any other means by
which I can serve you?"
</p>

<p>
For a time she could only reply by incoherencies
and with profuse thanks, for her mind was bewildered
by terror and agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Fear nothing, maiden," said I, "for a strong hand
and a stout heart are at your service.  I am Osman,
whose people dwelt by the Kisselbash River; you have
heard of me, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Aga&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Alas! no Aga am I; but a poor outcast, whose
sword and bow are his sole inheritance; yet you have
heard of me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and of your two brothers, Selim and Karolyi,
for to them and to you the people look as leaders when
war is made on the Muscovites."
</p>

<p>
"As soon it must be, maiden; and then I hope
to see the ramparts of yonder fortress of Anapa
flung into the Euxine.  But may I ask your
name?"
</p>

<p>
"Basilia," she replied, in a low voice, and drew her
veil yet closer.
</p>

<p>
"Basilia, the daughter of Abdallah ibn Obba, the
rich merchant of Soudjack Kaleh, who is said to be
making pyramids of gold by trading with Tartars of
the Crimea, and exporting from Sampsoon the copper
of Tocat, and the silks and fruit of Amasia?"
</p>

<p>
"I am the daughter of Abdallah, and, rich though
he is, I assure you he is yet poor in his own idea; for
neither the Prophet nor the santons can bound my
father's idea of wealth; but convey me to him, and
for the good deed of to-day, he will reward you, noble
Osman, by the most gorgeous suit of armour, the
richest weapons, and the noblest horse a Tcherkesse
warrior ever possessed."
</p>

<p>
"I seek no reward; let the horse and armour be
given to some poor patriot who is without them; I
seek no reward, Basilia," I continued, with enthusiasm,
"beyond your own approbation and the memory that
I have this day done a kind, and, it may be, a gallant
deed, in rescuing you from the fate which those sons
of the devil had in store for you; but how came you
into their hands?"
</p>

<p>
"We had gone on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the
Santon Seozeres among the mountains, when we fell
in with these marauders; my father's aged hands were
unable to protect me; he was struck to the earth;
his reverend beard was spat on, and his turban torn
off and flung in his face, while I was dragged from
the arms of my terrified attendants; but see, Osman
Rioni, they are now approaching us, and behold my
father."
</p>

<p>
She uttered a cry of joy, and rushed to meet the
old merchant Abdallah ibn Obba, who now came forward
on horseback, with rage, alarm, and grief in his
eyes, and his great turban awry.  He corroborated
her story, saying, that having a large ship, which had
long been delayed on her voyage from Stamboul, he
had paid a propitiatory visit to the tomb of Seozeres,
the most famous and powerful of Circassian Santons,
and the object of especial reverence by all merchants,
seamen, and dwellers on the coast; for the waves and
winds are reputed to be under his subjection, and the
storm and the thunderbolt are alike at his disposal;
thus we celebrate his festival in the early days of
spring, and when on this mission had Abdallah and
his daughter fallen among the Russians.
</p>

<p>
He gave me innumerable promises of remembrance
and regard (which he took especial care to forget),
and made his horse curvet several times over the dead
Russians, which seemed to console him mightily, and
smoothing his ruffled beard, he muttered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Death to them! death to them! the unbelievers,
the dogs, the infidels!  They shall be destroyed like
the wicked people of Noah and of Lot, and like the
army of Abraha, lord of the Elephant; and their
false gods and pretended saints of brass and of silver
shall perish with them!  Unless a fear of the Russ
prevent thee, Osman Rioni, I shall be glad to see
thee in Soudjack Kaleh, where a carpet and pipe,
with a cup of such coffee as Basilia alone can
prepare, will be at the service of her preserver; and
so, God and Merissa take thee into their holy keeping."
</p>

<p>
With these words we separated; the old merchant
and his daughter remounted on her own horse, rode
slowly away until they disappeared in the deepening
shades of evening; while I remained motionless, and
watching them, with a wild, sad beating in my heart,
for the face of Basilia seemed yet before me, and her
voice was lingering in my ear.
</p>

<p>
She was gone, but my soul went with her.
</p>

<p>
Full, round, and red as a Tartar shield, the moon
rose above the Isle of Taman to light the waters of
the Euxine; the mountains flung their black shadows
upon each other; the lurid glow-worm glittered on
the dewy grass, and the snakes began to hiss among
the long reeds; while the fierce vultures hovered in
the starry sky, with their keen eyes fixed on the grim
banquet I had made for them; and I heard their
hoarse croak of impatience, for I lingered long on the
spot where Abdallah and his daughter had left me.
</p>

<p>
Several days passed away.  Men spoke much of
the coming struggle with the Russians; my brave
brothers were as usual training their horses,
tempering their weapons, casting bullets, and pointing
arrows; I alone was silent, and full of soft, sad
thoughts&mdash;melancholy, happy, and anxious by turns;
for my whole breast was filled by the image of Basilia.
</p>

<p>
I visited her father by stealth, for this old man was
one who had temporised with the Russians, and paid
them a tribute that he might dwell in peace under
the cannon of Soudjack; but I found him gloomy,
thoughtful, and discontented; his ship had been
stranded on the Isle of Serpents, in the Black Sea,
and sunk with all her crew, and what was of more
importance to Abdallah, with her rich bales of Indian
silks, of cashmere shawls, of amber pipes, and other
valuables with which she was freighted.  This isle,
the only one in the Euxine, is infested by serpents of
enormous size, say our voyagers.  These guard its
boundless treasures and devour all who attempt to
land; thus Abdallah ibn Obba abandoned in grief all
hope of recovering a vestige of his property.
</p>

<p>
He received me morosely, and after smoking a pipe
and drinking with him a cup of coffee, which we
received from the white, gentle hands of Basilia, who
was enveloped as before in her veil of lace, I departed,
happy that I had seen but the tips of her dear fingers
once again; happy that I had been under the roof of
her father, and happy that for one brief hour I had
shared a corner of his carpet, and breathed the same
atmosphere with one so beautiful and so well-beloved
as she.
</p>

<p>
Again and again I came to visit Abdallah; for
alas!  I no longer sighed for the unfurling of our
green standard against the Russ; I only counted the
days and hours till again I should visit the house of
the merchant at Soudjack.
</p>

<p>
Secluded as the old man kept Basilia&mdash;for he
deemed her his last and most valuable estate&mdash;a piece
of property on which he could at any time realise a
thousand piastres in the Stamboul market&mdash;we had
nightly interviews; for what are the difficulties that
love cannot surmount?  I had discovered that her
chamber window opened into old Abdallah's garden;
its wall was easily crossed, and then three notes on my
lute were the signal which brought Basilia to me;
but she was beyond arm's length, and I never dared
to climb, though, had the wealth of Ormuz been mine,
I had given it all to have kissed but once her hand.
Yet, until she was bestowed upon me by her father,
what hope had I of ever doing so?
</p>

<p>
In the wild and half-civilised countries of the East,
a lover invests his mistress with a thousand imaginary
attributes, such as a lover of Europe or the West can
never do.  The seclusion in which we keep our
women, the danger and risk of approaching or even
speaking of them to their nearest relations, all
enhance the charm, the secresy, and the romance of an
Oriental love; and thus, with such a heart as mine, it
became an all-absorbing and engrossing passion, in
which to be without hope was to be without life.
Hourly I exclaimed to myself,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Bismillah! oh, Osman, happy thou to win a heart
like hers!" for Basilia responded as warmly as she
dared, or as I could have desired.
</p>

<p>
Nightly we conversed in whispers, and had our
interchange of love-letters; not that poor Basilia wrote,
or that I then could write; alas, no!  Our letters
were simply flowers, tied together with a ribband,
and in this symbolical language we conferred.  It is a
language lovers easily learn, and the Circassian sooner
than all.  I ransacked the bazaars of the Armenians
and Muscovites for gaudy trinkets and perfumes, as
presents for Basilia; and fearless of the Russ, I daily
caracoled my horse&mdash;my Zupi&mdash;before her father's
house, that she might see me attired in the glittering
arms and splendid costume of a Circassian cavalier;
and happy was I&mdash;oh, how happy! if but once I saw
the muslin-veiled form of my beautiful Basilia.  At
her feet I laid the shawls of Cashmere and the beads
of Bokhara.  She gave me a waist-belt embroidered
by herself, and a morocco breast-pocket to hold my
cartridges, in return.
</p>

<p>
Summoning up courage, I one day put on my most
splendid habiliments; my coat of mail, which shone
like water in the sun; a helmet of steel, damascened
by my own hands; and I armed myself with weapons
which, like every Tcherkesse warrior, I had tempered
and ornamented with silver and precious stones, all
by my own skill.  Bathed, perfumed, and anointed,
I rode up to the door of Abdallah ibn Obba; and
while my heart trembled and died away within me,
and my colour came and went like that of a woman
under the bowstring, I asked his daughter in
marriage.  He heard me in ominous silence.
</p>

<p>
"May God be with thee, Abdallah," said I.
</p>

<p>
"With thee be God," said he, and paused again,
on which I timidly rehearsed all I had said.
</p>

<p>
The old merchant, who was seated on a rich carpet,
with his legs folded under him, and a split reed,
ink-horn, and piles of papers and accounts on one side
of him, and his fragrant narguillah on the other,
heard me without moving a muscle of his solemn
visage; and after smoking for some time, drew the
yellow mouthpiece from his mustachioed lips, and
shaking his bushy beard, replied to me, slowly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"May you be saluted, O Osman Rioni!  No&mdash;no,
Osman, this cannot be!  The son of a prince weds a
prince's daughter, even as a slave weds the daughter
of a slave.  Thus, the rich give their children in
marriage only to the rich, and thou, Osman, art very
poor.  Remember, that this daughter may yet be a
mine of wealth to me."
</p>

<p>
I knew what the old wretch meant by these
words&mdash;the market of Stamboul&mdash;and my blood ran cold.
</p>

<p>
"Her beauty," he resumed, "is a miracle, and her
birth was also a miracle; hence sho was born for
great purposes, and may yet be a source of delight to
him who wears the sword of Omar, our Lord the
Sultan Abdul Medjid&mdash;who can tell?  She was born
of my first wife, Tsha; when she was old, stricken in
years, and hopelessly barren, on seeing a hen feed her
chickens one day, her heart was moved; she wept and
prayed the holy Prophet to give her a little child in
her old age, whereupon she had Basilia in the fulness
of time; so thus I tell thee, she was born for great
things.  Enough, enough, Osman Rioni, go thy ways,
for thou art very poor."
</p>

<p>
"True, father," said I, while my heart became
chilled with despair; "I am poor, and my brothers
Selim and Karolyi are also poor, for we have no
inheritance but the name of our father, and what we
can wrench in combat from the enemies of our
country, and for every meal of food we have to fight
the convoys of the Russ on the mountain, or the wild
beasts in the forest; but a time is at hand when I
shall have all my father's patrimony again, when the
forts of the Kuban shall lie in ruins by its shore,
while the wolf shall batten on the bones of their
defenders.  A time shall come when I may ride from
the grassy steppes of Marinskoi to the reedy flow of
the Kisselbash River, lord of all the land my father
bequeathed to me, with this sword, when the Russian
bayonets were clashing in his heart!"
</p>

<p>
"God is great," replied the merchant, calmly;
"when that time comes return, and seek my
daughter, but not till then."
</p>

<p>
He replaced the amber tube of the narguillah in
his mouth, waved his hand to indicate that he wished
to hear no more on the subject, and dismissed me,
with a heart swollen by grief and mortification.  I
felt how low the son of Mostapha was fallen when a
miserable trader despised his alliance!  God of
Mohammed, had we come to this?
</p>

<p>
As I rode slowly back to the poor village where
with my brothers I dwelt on the hills above Anapa,
I revolved a thousand schemes of daring and conquest;
for Basilia was now to me a light&mdash;a star&mdash;a
guide; but between us I saw the dark battalions
and the strong ramparts of the abhorred Russians,
and worse than all, the cunning and the avarice of her
selfish father.  Could I repel one, or bound the
other?
</p>

<p>
When riding slowly on I saw a raven in my path,
and shuddering at the bird of ill omen, turned aside,
for I knew it was a sign of coming evil; because
there is an old tradition in the countries of the East,
that Cain, after committing fratricide, became sorely
troubled in mind, and bore about with him for many
days the dead body of his brother, until Heaven
taught him how to bury it, by the example of a raven,
which after killing another in his presence dug a little
pit for it by beak and talon; and so scraping a hole
with his hands, Cain interred his brother at the foot
of a palm, whose branches heretofore erect drooped
mournfully for ever after.  Then the murderous
raven which had perched itself on a branch thereof
flew away to Adam, and croaked huskily in his ear
that his youngest born was now slain and buried, and
from that hour the raven has been a bird of evil
augury to all the world.  And now my heart became
a prey to a thousand dark and gloomy forebodings.
The bird had not come to me for nought.
</p>

<p>
I prayed Merissa, the mother of God, to take Basilia
under her protection, for, like the Christians, we
believe in the intercession of a woman, though,
perhaps, her name is but a remnant of the faith that was
first preached to the Circassians before the banner
of the blessed Prophet swept the gods of error from
the shores of the Caspian Sea.
</p>

<p>
Night was closing as I ascended the mountain,
when suddenly from a gorge there rose that wild and
terrible yell which is the war-cry of Circassia; and
led by Schamyl, the conquering, the holy Murid
Schamyl, a host of mounted warriors, all clad in
shirts of shining steel and round helmets, armed
with lance and musket, bow and sabre, each with a
bag of millet and bottle of skhou slung at his saddle
for service, dashed their fleet horses through the
narrow way, and above their heads waved the green
standard of the confederated princes with its three
golden arrows and twelve white stars&mdash;the Sangiac
Sheerif&mdash;the sacred banner of our people, for green
is the colour of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
Selim and Karolyi were among them, and they
sprang to my side with joy and ardour.
</p>

<p>
A vast Russian army of horse, foot, and artillery,
they told me, had just passed the shores of the
Kuban, and entered among the mountains; Schamyl,
the holy murids who devote themselves to death, and
all our confederated princes, had summoned the land to
battle, and every man between the straits of Yenikale
and the Mingrelian frontier was in arms for Circassia
Thus opened the Christian year 1840, so memorable
to us by the capture of all the frontier forts of the
Russians by our arms, but chiefly those of Mikhailov
and Nikhailovska.
</p>

<p>
The excitement, the glory, and the splendour of
our mountain host equipped for war, with the hopes of
conquest and of triumph, filled my soul with such
ardour and exultation that my emotion nearly overcame
me.  The hope of winning back in this war, if
it was successful, the land, the home, and the grave
of my forefathers, and with these the flower of the
Abassian maids for my bride, made me pant for the
hour of battle with such ardour as never bridegroom
awaited the unveiling of his new-made wife.
</p>

<p>
The great Dervish Mohammed Mansoor, from the
misty land of Daghestan, had foretold our triumph
when he died at Anapa, and we never doubted we
should be victorious.
</p>

<p>
Over my father's fugitive people a command was
assigned me by the confederated princes; my
brothers, Selim and Karolyi, rode by my side; all who
followed us shared our ardour, and we were brave
even to ferocity: thus, pouring down from the
snow-capped Alps of the Caucasus towards the hosts of the
Russ, then blackening and desolating the banks of
the Kuban, while their fleets of three deckers and
steamers scared the golden dolphins from our shores,
we commenced the desperate war of 1840.
</p>

<p>
I was full of delicious hope, and the last words of
Basilia, for I had visited her in secret before we
marched, were ever in my ears,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hope for everything from Heaven, O Osman.
The angels of Mohammed will deliver you from the
swords of the Russians, and like all, my beloved,
who fight against the spirit, they shall wither and
perish!"
</p>

<p>
Her prophetic words inspired me with new ardour.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, Basilia," I exclaimed, as I grasped the
mane of Zupi; "we go to teach those Muscovite
liars who mark our country in their maps that the
Circassians have no masters save God and the
Prophet."

CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE HUSSARS OF TENGINSKI
</h3>

<p>
How we swept the land of Kisliar, continued the
Circassian captain; how we baffled the foe beneath
the towers of Dargo; how Schamyl the Immortal did
prodigies of valour at Unsorilla and destroyed the
army of Count Woronzoff, the Governor of New
Russia, one hundred and fifty thousand in number,
whose bones yet lie in the forest of Itzkeri; how we
fought with desperation, neither asking nor giving
quarter, and how we hurled the Russians from the
slopes of the Caucasus back upon the shores of the
Kuban, where they lay unburied save by the jaws of
the wolf and eagle, torn and disembowelled by
hungry dogs, all Europe knows full well; and how
successive armies, full of barbarous pride and military
and religious enthusiasm, horsemen, artillery, and
infantry&mdash;hussars and Cossacks, Kurds and Tartar
hordes, who had stooped their necks to Russia's iron
yoke, entered the valleys of Circassia, valleys which
seem but dark chasms or fissures where the branches
of the Koissons roar and leap from rock to rock
in northern Daghestan, and there they perished, too,
beneath the bullet and the arrow, the spear and sling
of the unconquerable Tcherkesses.  It was my
brother Selim who slew General Woinoff; it was
Karolyi who stormed the redoubts and spiked his cannon:
and it was I who hewed off the head of the gallant
soldier Passek, and bore it for three days on my
spear.
</p>

<p>
In this year of the Christians, 1840, I commanded
that portion of the Circassian troops which besieged
the Russians in the fort of Mikhailov.  They
defended themselves with the blind fury of men who
foresaw their doom was death!  Selim pressed them
with three thousand men on one side; Karolyi, with
the same number, pressed them on the other; while
I, with a chosen band of four thousand archers,
slingers, and musketeers, plied them from every
quarter with incessant missiles.  Selim cut off the
sluices which supplied them with water, and Karolyi
stormed their outworks, tore down their stockades, and
beheaded every defender whom they caught by the
lasso.
</p>

<p>
But Heaven has put much valour into the hearts of
these infidels; hence, though reduced to the verge of
starvation (having picked the bones of their last horse,
and stewed their boot-tops and leather shakoes), their
commander, Ivan Carlovitch, colonel of the Tenginski
Hussars, resolved to make one gallant effort to
escape, for his soldiers had with them several old
standards, which the Russians regard as almost holy.
</p>

<p>
His garrison was composed of the 37th or Tenginski
Grenadiers; the 38th or Novoginski Regiment,
which carried the famous banner of St. George, the
same that had been with their predecessors at the
passage of the Alps, and which waved on the field of
Trebbia, where they fought under Suvaroff.  He
had also two battalions of the Imperial Guard, whose
tattered and shot-riven standards had waved on many
a bloody plain, and been clenched in the dying grasp
of many a gallant man.
</p>

<p>
Their desire of preserving these trophies was only
second to the hope of escape; for the standard is
ever the palladium of a regiment, even as the
National Insignia are the palladium of a free people,
and, as such, should be preserved from degradation.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that, fearless of his cannon&mdash;those
terrors of the simple Circassians, who name them the
great pistols of the Czar&mdash;I had made every disposition
for an assault, which must have been successful,
the valiant Ivan Carlovitch led out his shattered
garrison among us, sword in hand; and, favoured by a
dark and tempestuous night, escaped with a few, but
a few only; for by sabre and by musket we made a
fearful slaughter among the soldiers of the Novoginski
Regiment, and taking their famous banner of
St. George, tore it to fragments, and spitting upon
these, trampled them to the earth in blood and mire.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the Prophet and to my coat of mail,
uncounted balls and bayonets touched me without harm.
Above the roar of that red musketry which lit the
darkness with its streaky gleams; above the howling
of the wind, which tore through every mountain
gorge; above the cheers of the desperate, and the
shrieks of the dying, the wild, shrill, and unearthly
war-cry of the Circassians ascended to the throne of
Mohammed; and the approach to the breach was like
the bridge of hell, as we rushed through the battered
gates to take possession of the fortress; but at the
moment that the 'enceinte,' or interior wall which
surrounded the place, and was composed of bastions
faced with brick, was crowded by our flushed and
exulting warriors, a tremendous explosion was heard
the earth gaped, and rocked, and rent; then it rose
beneath our feet; a broad, hot, scorching blaze of fire
surrounded me, and blown up by a concealed mine of
powder, the whole fort of Mikhailov, with more than
two thousand Circassians, was torn from its
foundations, and swept on the whirlwind along the
mountain slopes.
</p>

<p>
Struck down by a stone in the moment of victory
I became senseless, and remember no more of that
night of horrors!
</p>

<p>
Heaven, I have said, has put great valour into the
hearts of these unbelievers.
</p>

<p>
Archipp Ossepoff, the same grenadier of the
Tenginski Regiment whom I had wounded by an arrow
and from whom I had rescued Basilia, volunteered to
remain behind his comrades; and in order to prevent
the fort from being of service to the confederated
princes, laid his hands solemnly on the standard of
St. George, and promised to Ivan Carlovitch, that he
would fire the magazine&mdash;a noble act of self-sacrifice
and military enthusiasm.  This man of course perished
with Mikhailov, and with our people; but in order to
commemorate this act of valour and devotion, the
Emperor Nicholas ordained that his name should be
continued on the muster-roll of the Tenginski
Grenadiers; that it should be called daily on parade, and
that on the sergeant summoning "Archipp Ossepoff,"
the next grenadier on the list should answer&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dead at Mikhailov for the glory of Russia!"
</p>

<p>
When I recovered, I found myself lying on the hillside,
many yards from the fort, the site of which
resembled the crater of the volcano; for it seemed as if
the powder had rent, torn, and blackened the bosom
of the earth, in its efforts to efface the fort for ever.
The free soft wind of the Caucasus was passing over
the ruins; above me the sky was bright, and blue, and
sunny; the birds were twittering among the mangled
bodies of the slain; and about those ghastly heaps,
or between their piles of arms and limbered
field-pieces, the Russian soldiers (whom the flight of our
people had left in possession of the locality) were
laughing and singing, as they drained their canteens
of sour quass, and prepared to cook their breakfasts,
and to bury the dead.
</p>

<p>
Around us, the scenery was beautiful; there were
summer woods in all their heavy foliage; the terraced
vineyards of lighter green, screened by the dense and
wiry pine; little cottages and pretty mosques, with
gilded minars shining in the sun; bright streams
dancing down the rocks; the sea, blue as the sky and
rippling gently in the wind; while in the back-ground
of all, rose hills piled up on hills, until their steeps
reached Heaven, and every peak was capped with
pure white snow, or tipped by a golden gleam.
</p>

<p>
Close by me a group of Russian officers were
seated around one, who, by his dark green uniform,
his heavy silver epaulettes and jack-boots; his
varnished leather helmet surmounted by an eagle; his
enormous mustache and cruel expression of eye, I
knew to be Ivan Carlovitch; and I lay still and feigning
death, believing that my fate would be sealed, if
life was discovered in me.
</p>

<p>
They were loud in their praises of the Circassian
leader&mdash;myself&mdash;and expressed a great desire to capture
me; others added their less friendly hopes that I
had perished in the explosion.
</p>

<p>
"It is fortunate, however," said Carlovitch, "that
we have taken his two brothers, Selim and Karolyi;
they, at least, have a long march before them towards
the north; and, believe me, that among the snows
there, with a chain to drag, and the occasional prick
of a Cossack lance in the rear, their hot rebellious
blood will soon be cooled in Siberia, and rendered
mild as commissariat quass."
</p>

<p>
Under their shaggy beards the officers laughed at
this poor joke, which made my heart almost die
within me, for it acquainted me, that my two brothers,
Selim and Karolyi, were captives, and that Siberia
would be their doom.
</p>

<p>
A soldier now approached to announce that the
body of Archipp Ossepoff had been found, shattered,
scorched, and sorely mangled, but still recognisable
by the medals which he had won in the Polish war.
</p>

<p>
"Then let him be buried apart from all the rest,"
said Carlovitch, "with all honour, and let a cross
mark the spot; but first, let us put all these fellows
who are lying about here under ground, before the
sun attains its noon-day heat."
</p>

<p>
While lying there, receiving an occasional kick
from the passing soldiers, who had long since stripped
me of my splendid arms, armour, and ornaments, how
terrible were my thoughts when the fierce, rough,
and merciless Cossacks proceeded to open a trench
beside me, and dug it deep to receive the dead.  I
endeavoured to stifle reflection, believing that my last
hour had come; and after praying&mdash;for prayer is the
pillar of religion, even as the sword is the true key
of paradise&mdash;I bent my thoughts upon Basilia, who
was far away at Soudjack Kaleh, and seated then
perhaps in her rose garden, fanning herself with
feathers, and weeping for the poor Osman she would
never again behold on earth.
</p>

<p>
At last the grave was finished, and one by one the
dead were flung therein, and laid in rows head and
foot alternately; how heavily they fell, with their
lifeless limbs and clanking accoutrements!  Suddenly I
felt myself seized by the neck and heels, and before
I could utter a sound, they flung me into that ghastly
trench on the gashed and bloody heap below, and
then the shovelled earth flew fast over me.
</p>

<p>
"Stop&mdash;halt!" cried Ivan Carlovitch, who was
sitting on the sward close by, smoking a magnificent
pipe; "by St. George, that uppermost Tcherkesse is
alive yet!"
</p>

<p>
"A matter easily repaired, my colonel!" said a
Russian, raising his shovel like a battle-axe to cleave
my head.
</p>

<p>
"Beware, I say!" thundered Carlovitch, and at his
voice the bearded soldiers cowered like slaves before
a king; "fling him out, lay him on the sward, and
bring here a canteen of quass."
</p>

<p>
This sharp, bitter draught revived me, and my
native pride coming to my aid, I stood erect, and
boldly confronted the imperialist.
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil are you?" he asked
</p>

<p>
I replied, proudly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Osman Rioni, the son of Mostapha.  I might
have concealed my rank, but I scorn to lie, even unto
a race of liars."
</p>

<p>
Joy flashed in the cruel and cunning eyes of Carlovitch
at this announcement; his surprise and satisfaction
at the importance of his third prisoner were
too great to leave space for anger at my speech.  He
smiled, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Tcherkesse, your wants and your wounds, if you
have any, shall be faithfully and kindly attended to;
when in better humour I shall see you again, having
a little message to you from the emperor.  Take him
away."
</p>

<p>
I was conducted to an ancient tomb, under the dome
of which I found a Cossack guard, surrounding my
two brothers Selim and Karolyi, with several other
Circassians, who were all suffering more or less from
wounds or scorches ha the explosion.  All were
dejected, and my appearance among them increased
their unhappiness.  We communed in whispers, and
formed our plans for flight on the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
All that night we remained in the cold and dreary
tomb, which before morning some of our poor companions
exchanged for an actual grave, for they died
of their undressed wounds; but about sunrise, we
were drawn out by the Cossacks, who truncheoned us
with their lances, driving us like a herd of cattle; and
then their pioneers proceeded to dig a grave under
the dome, which was the resting-place of an ancient
king, a proceeding which we beheld with horror, for
every strict Mussulman deems sacred for ever the
little spot of earth which forms the last resting-place
of a departed being.
</p>

<p>
Then the sound of muffled drums rolled upon the
wind and the wail of the Muscovite dead march, as
the funeral of Archipp Ossepoff approached; the
solemnity of the scene impressed us deeply, and we
forgot that it was by the mingled treachery and stern
devotion of this determined soldier we had lost
Mikhailov and our liberty together.
</p>

<p>
Six grenadiers of the Tenginski Regiment bore on
their shoulders the coffin, the lid of which was off;
a veil of fine linen covered the body, which was
dressed in uniform, with cross-belts, boots, gloves,
epaulettes of red worsted and copper medals.  The
head was borne forward, not the feet, as in other
countries.  Then came four soldiers, bearing the
coffin lid, on which lay the leather helmet, the musket,
and knapsack of the deceased; then followed the
regiment of Tenginski Grenadiers, marching with
their arms reversed, and preceded by a grand military
band of brass trumpets and muffled drums.  In front
of all marched a priest of the Russian Greek Church,
attired in magnificent vestments of muslin, gold, and
embroidery.  His aspect was venerable; his white
beard was full and flowing; he chaunted as he went,
and sprinkled frankincense upon the path.
</p>

<p>
A prayer, a roll upon the drums, and a flourish of
instruments with three volleys closed the ceremony,
and there lies Archipp Ossepoff in the tomb of a
Circassian prince; but his memory as a brave grenadier
is still cherished, as I have related, by the orders of
the emperor, and in the traditions of his comrades.
God rest that gallant spirit; he died for his country,
even as I would have died for mine.
</p>

<p>
Pining for freedom and for the presence of Basilia,
dreading I scarcely knew what&mdash;but banishment to
Siberia more than anything else, for that had been
but a living death and a separation for ever from my
country and my love&mdash;three dreary months rolled
over me, and with my two brothers I still found
myself a prisoner with the Russian army of the Caucasus,
which marched along the left bank of the Kuban
towards the Sea of Azov, and consequently nearer to
my home.
</p>

<p>
One day Colonel Carlovitch sent for me, and again
his face wore that deep and cunning smile which so
closely resembled a leer; for his eyes were cold and
snaky, even as his heart was stern and cruel.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent for you, my valiant Tcherkesse," said
he, politely, "to make you a tempting offer from our
beneficent father the emperor.  It is this.  If you
will enter the Russian service, all your father's
possessions from Marinskoi to the mouth of the Kisselbash
River will be restored to you, with the title of
prince&mdash;neither of which can you ever hope to regain by the
impious sword you have drawn against the house of
Romanoff and the cause of Holy Russia."
</p>

<p>
I rejected the offer with the scorn it merited, and
reminded the tempter, in the words of our "Declaration
of Independence," how many of our children had
been stolen; how many of our princes had thus been
lured away; how many sons of nobles taken as
hostages, and then butchered in cold blood; how
many noble houses had been reduced and crushed by
Russian treason and by Russian treachery; and lifting
up my hands, while I turned my face towards Mecca,
I was about to take a solemn vow, when interrupting
me, he said, with an icy smile,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Enough, Osman Rioni&mdash;swear not&mdash;'t is needless!
To-morrow you and your brothers will commence the
long, long march to Siberia."
</p>

<p>
At these words my soul trembled, and my head fell
upon my breast.  The Russian officer still smiled and
continued to polish the eagle on his helmet, with his
leather glove, while whistling the popular waltz of the
Duchess Olga.
</p>

<p>
Siberia!
</p>

<p>
With that name, hope, love, liberty, my country
and her cause sank, and snow-covered wastes, with
chains and stripes, despair and death, rose up before
me.
</p>

<p>
If once I reached Siberia, I should live the life of
the hopeless, and die the death of the despairing;
and my brothers&mdash;my poor brothers!  The alternative
was terrible, but in the Russian service we should
daily have chances of escape to our native mountains;
so I accepted his offer in the name of myself, Selim,
and Karolyi.
</p>

<p>
"I knew that you would think better of it," said
Carlovitch, sitting down in his tent, and writing a
memorandum; "thenceforward from this day, you are
a captain in the Tenginski Hussars, and your brothers
shall be the lieutenants of your troop.  Allow me to
present you with a horse which was taken at
Mikhailov.  You shall fight against the Tartars, not your
own people; but to-morrow I have a piece of service
to propose to you.  Come here after morning parade
or at noon, and I shall tell you all about it&mdash;meantime
adieu."
</p>

<p>
With a heart full of bitterness I left him, and careless
of the Cossacks, who still watched me, I took up
a handful of gravel and flung it towards his painted
tent, spying, as Mohammed did at Bedr,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A curse upon thee, Muscovite&mdash;and a curse be on
every hair of the cur that begot thee!  May thy face
be confounded for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Whichever way I turned, his cold smile seemed
before me; but when I reached the tent in which my
brothers were confined, great was my pleasure to find
my favourite charger Zupi led up to the door by a
hussar, and I kissed and embraced my old friend, for
we Mussulmen deem the horse as the noblest of
animals next to man; and the Koran says, that the
beasts which traverse earth and air are creatures like
ourselves&mdash;they are all written in the Book, and shall
appear at the last day; so when I die, I hope to take
my faithful Zupi with me to paradise, even as Ezra
took his ass, after she had ceased to bray for a
hundred years.
</p>

<p>
Like myself, at the first proposition of taking
service under the abhorred emperor, my brothers were
full of fierce scorn; but when I had calmly placed my
views before them, showing that we had no alternative
but military service, with its chances of escape on one
hand, and perpetual slavery, with its stripes on the
other, they condescended to accept the lieutenantcies
of my troop; and the next day&mdash;oh, may it be
accursed!&mdash;saw us attired in the green uniform of the
Tenginski Hussars, and on parade with Menschikoff's
division of the Caucasian army.
</p>

<p>
In camp around us were bivouacked thousands of
the Russian infantry in their long great-coats and
flat round caps; the Cossacks of the Don with their
fleet, rough, and active horses, and all armed with long
lances; the horse regiments of Tchernemorski glittering
with jewels and embroidery, and the Imperial
Guard in their magnificent uniform.  Around us rang
the clank of the armourer's anvil, the springing of
ramrods and fixing of flints; the limbering of
artillery and powder-waggons; the galloping of aides-de-camp;
the hewing down of palisades, and the plaiting
up of fascines, all of which told us of preparations
making for the subjugation of our country, and
we were amid it all, attired in the Russian uniform!
</p>

<p>
At noon I sought the tent of Carlovitch.
</p>

<p>
"My colonel," said I, veiling my boiling hatred
under a calm exterior, as with a solemn salaam I
raised a hand to the front of my fur hussar cap;
"you had a duty to propose to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my stubborn Tcherkesse; I am glad to find
that you have so easily learned the task of obedience,
as without it an army sinks into a rabble.  Well, the
duty is this.  There is an old fellow at Soudjack
Kaleh, who for some time past has traded with the
Tartars in various ways, and latterly with Turks in
salted fish and pretty women, both of which commodities
he exports largely to Stamboul, to the ancient
city of Trebizonde, and to Sinope."
</p>

<p>
My heart began to leap at these words.
</p>

<p>
"You mean Abdallah ibn Obba."
</p>

<p>
"The same; but you start&mdash;do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Intimately," said I; "and your purpose, O son of
a slave!" I had almost added.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain Rioni, this respectable old Tcherkesse
is now bargaining for the sale of a cargo of
slave girls for the Turkish market, and a small
Stambouli craft, which has long baffled the pursuit of our
steam corvettes and the row-boats of our Kreposts, is
now concealed in some creek near Mezip.  Unfortunately
all our vessels are over on the Crimean side,
otherwise they would soon have found those Turkish
swine, who come to steal the subjects of our father
the emperor."
</p>

<p>
Carlovitch gave another of his cold smiles, for he
perceived how my hot Circassian blood revolted on
hearing my people called the subjects of his emperor
I asked haughtily,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your orders, Colonel Carlovitch?"
</p>

<p>
"You will select fifty of the Tenginski Hussars, and
as you and your brothers must know the country well,
search every creek and cranny of the coast until the
Turkish ship is found.  She will be safely beached
somewhere, and when discovered, burn her; cut the
throats of the Turks, and bring the cargo of girls
here.  You shall have a couple of the prettiest for
your trouble.  The daughter of old Abdallah is
among them&mdash;Basilia, commonly known as the flower
of the Abassians.  Archipp Ozepoff nearly brought me
that girl once before, but some rascal pierced him by
an arrow.  Take especial care of her, for I am
resolved that no great bison of a Turk shall ever call
her slave.  No, no, her bright eyes will sparkle all
the brighter among the green uniforms and silver
epaulettes of our Tenginski Hussars.  See to all this;
you march in an hour, and till you return, farewell."
</p>

<p>
Taking up a pen he resumed a dispatch which my
arrival had interrupted; and after standing for some
time, overwhelmed by confusion and the misery of
my own thoughts, I withdrew to the foot of a tree,
and sat down to reflect on the strange duty I had to
perform, and the startling tidings I had just heard.
</p>

<p>
The image of my beautiful Basilia&mdash;for I assure
you, gentlemen, that the Circassian maid is the most
perfect and lovely creation of God&mdash;a prisoner, a
slave on board of a slave ship, and consigned a helpless
victim of the lust of the licentious Osmanli filled
my soul with a horror so great that I forgot my
present situation in my anxiety to discover this secret
ship, to free her, and to put to the edge of the sword
all who were concerned in a transaction so infamous.
I saw the whole affair now.  The loss of the rich
argosy on the Isle of Serpents had brought the
difficulties of Abdallah to a crisis, and to retrieve his
broken fortune he had sold his only daughter to the
Turks!  I invoked the curse of the Prophet, and of
the twelve Imaums on his avarice; and now my only
fear was great that the Turks might launch their
boat and escape me: thus it was that with an ardour
such as I never thought to feel at the head of Russian
troops, I rode from the camp at the head of fifty
hussars, with my two brothers by my side; and we
galloped along the sea-shore, with all our brilliant
appointments glittering in the splendour of the setting
sun of Asia.
</p>

<p>
"Basilia, my pure, my beautiful! this night may
make thee mine," thought I; "one stroke of a sabre
may give what thy father would not have sold to me,
perhaps, for a million of piastres."
</p>

<p>
I am ashamed to own that our Circassian beauties
too often exchange with joy the penury of their
fathers' cottages and the hardships of their frugal
mountain homes, for the luxury and delight of the
Stambouli Kiosks and seraglios.  From early childhood
their ears are filled, and their warm imaginations
fired, with ideas of the riches and pleasure of these
places, and by the stories of their mothers, or more
generally their aunts, who have returned (when their
Osmanli lords grew weary of their faded charms)
loaded with magnificent jewels, with purses of sequins,
and wardrobes of the richest stuffs the world can
produce, and with many a tale to tell of the
distinguished part they had played by their native
superiority of intellect over the ponderous and dreamy
Asiatic.  To purchase our girls the Turkish vessels
row by night along the shore, and seek some wooded
creek where they lie concealed from the steamers and
cruisers of the Russian Black Sea fleet, and from the
squadrons of Cossack row-boats attached to the
Kreposts; then the bargain is concluded, and the girls,
who are always the most beautiful daughters of serfs
and freemen, are embarked, after a month, perhaps,
has been spent in bartering and chaffering between
the merchants on one hand, and their parents on the
other.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* It is calculated that one vessel out of six is taken.  In the
winter of 1843-4, twenty-eight ships left the coast of Asia
Minor for Circassia, to purchase girls; twenty-three returned
safely; three only were burned by the Russians, and two were
swallowed by the waves.&mdash;WAGNER
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the distance increased between us and the
Russian camp my brothers looked with longing eyes
towards our native hills, between whose misty peaks
a flood of golden light was falling on the waving
woods and on the rolling sea; and now they began to
whisper and exchange glances of intelligence.  Their
minds were full of the pledge we had lately made to
ourselves, that we would fly the hated yoke of
Russia on the first opportunity; but this was no easy
task, believe me, watched as we were by our own
suspicious soldiers.  At this time my whole soul was
full of Basilia, and in the hope of freeing, of winning,
and of loving her, even Circassia and her wrongs
were forgotten for a time&mdash;God of the Prophet, but
only for a time!
</p>

<p>
By a telescope I could see afar off the wild woods
in which I had wandered when a boy, and the familiar
mountain peaks up which I had clambered when
fighting with the Muscovite riflemen, or hunting the
boar and jerboa.  I could see the bright gleam of
steel and the flashing of chain armour between the
shady oaks; for there armed bands were hovering, and
there the Tartar bow, the Albanian gun, the Circassian
lance, and the crooked sabre, awaited the Muscovite
invader; and there the holy banner of the twelve
stars waved above the tent of the glorious Schamyl.
Watched as we were by the very men we led, flight, as
I have said, was hopeless; but then I had no thought of
flight even when within a cannon-shot of armed
Circassian bands which we could see with their camels
laden with women, children, and household goods,
clambering up the hills to avoid the Kalmuck scouts
and Cossack foragers.
</p>

<p>
As the night darkened we saw lurid flames shooting
up between the mountain clefts; and while our fierce
hussars muttered in guttural Russ and laughed under
their matted beards, the hearts of my brothers and
myself grew sad, for we knew that the Tchernemorski
lances were spreading woe and desolation in the
homes of our people.
</p>

<p>
We searched every little bay, inlet, and river as we
passed along the beautiful coast from Anapa to Soudjack
Kaleh, a fortress which was then half in ruins, as
General Williamoff had left it after storming its defences
at the head of fifteen thousand men.  It seemed now
so lonely and so silent that no one could imagine the
roar of war had once awoke its echoes, for the flowers
of the arbutus, the rhododendron, and many other
plants, most of them aromatic, filled the air with
perfume as they grew in luxuriance on its battered walls,
or twining round the old cannon's mouth as it lay
half sunk among the stones and grass, or wreathing
the bare skulls and white ribs of the dead on whose
unburied bones, bleached by the sunshine and the
storm, devouring dogs and mountain wolves had
battened.
</p>

<p>
Evening had closed when we bivouacked near the
beach, unbitted our horses, lighted our pipes, and sent
round our cups of quass to wash down the black ration,
bread and salt beef broiled among the embers till it
was encrusted with ashes and brine; and we were
just composing ourselves for the night, when my
sergeant, a cunning and active Cossack, who had crept
a mile or two along the shore alone, announced to
me that he had seen some suspicious lights in a little
creek of the bay of Koutloutzi.  "Mount and march,"
was the order, and favoured by a brilliant moon,
beneath whose light the Euxine rolled like a flood of
silver at the base of the steep Circassian hills, we rode
round the margin of this circular bay, and ascended
the beautiful vale of Mezip, towards where my
sergeant asserted he had seen the lights.
</p>

<p>
Halting our party he and I dismounted, and, taking
only our swords and pistols, crept cautiously through
a thicket towards where a river entered the bay, and
such a place we knew would be the most probable
rendezvous of the Turks with the slave merchant.
The foliage was dense and dark overhead, for in
this district the sturdy oak, the beech, and the
chestnut grew to the water's edge, and the cherry-tree,
the fig, and the wild olive were all in full
bloom.  It was a savage place.  Toads croaked
among the reeds, and rearing serpents hissed among
the sedges of the river, which brawled over a ledge
of rocks and fell into the bay, while the
yellow-coated and weasel-like suroke whistled on the
branches of the pine, and the fleet jerboa fled
before us from its lair like an evil spirit.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly we saw a gleam of light, and heard the
sound of voices.  A few paces more brought us to
the brow of a wooded bank, at the base of which we
saw a number of Turkish sailors seated round a fire,
smoking, drinking raki, and making merry, while one
of their number, a little humpbacked fellow, with a
hooked nose and enormous beard, sang to them, and
twangled on a lute.  They were sixteen in number
(I counted them carefully), and all fierce-looking
fellows, with enormous noses and mustachoes.  Large
trowsers, dirty red tarbooshes, and red shawl-girdles
stuck full of daggers and pistols.  Most of them had
cuts and scars or patches on their dusky faces, and all
had a savage and sinister aspect, as the red gleams of
the pinewood fire fell on them.  The captain was
particularly happy; as he believed, that if the Sultan
Abdul-Medjid did but once see Basilia, the fortunes of
all who had a share in bringing such loveliness
to gladden his sublime eyes would be made for ever.
</p>

<p>
In the back-ground, and drawn far up on the beach,
lay their vessel, with its large angular sail stowed on
deck; the yard struck, and the mast and rigging
covered by green pine branches, the better to elude
the observation of scouts, and to blend its outline
with the surrounding trees, while heaps of branches,
with dry leaves spread over all, were piled against the
sides.  But over the gunnel we saw several Circassian
girls sitting very quietly, gazing at those rough and
noisy guardians, who were to convey them to that
brilliant Stamboul, which they had been taught to
believe was an earthly paradise.
</p>

<p>
On that little deck, and apart from all the rest, sat
one who did not seem to share the placidity of her
companions, or to share their joyous anticipations.
Her form was enveloped in her veil, and her head
was bowed upon her hands, her eyes were sad, and
fixed on vacancy.  My breath came thick and fast.
There was a swelling in my throat, as if my heart
was there, for I knew that lonely weeper was Basilia.
</p>

<p>
As thirty or forty girls are usually deemed a good
cargo and only ten were visible, it was evident to us
that the Turks had no intention of putting to sea for
some days; thus my sergeant, who had frequently
been on expeditions of this kind, politely
suggested&mdash;as we had ridden a long way&mdash;the expedience of
sleeping quietly for that night, and slaughtering the
Turks at our leisure in the morning; but my
impatience would brook of no delay.
</p>

<p>
Again we mounted: I divided my party into two
troops, and ascending the valley of Mezip for a mile
or so, descended from different points towards the
head of the Bay.
</p>

<p>
"Spur and sabre!" was the cry.
</p>

<p>
There was a brief but sharp discharge of pistols, a
gleaming of knives and flashing of sabres, and in five
minutes the surrounded Turks were all trampled
under hoof, shot and headless beside the fire which
had lit the scene of their jollity, not one of them
escaping save their deformed messmate, who dashed
his lute at the head of Selim, sprung into the sea, and
disappeared.  The captain I sabred with my own
hand; but not before he gave me this wound by a
pistol shot, which grazed my left cheek like a hot
iron.
</p>

<p>
Inspired anew by love and triumph I sprang up
the side of the vessel, and sought the lonely figure&mdash;it
was as my heart divined&mdash;Basilia.  I knelt before
her, and took her hand in mine, trembling as I did so,
for never until that moment had I touched even the
hem of her garment.  My soul was in my tongue, and
weighed it down with words of love and joy, but one
alone found utterance,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Basilia!"
</p>

<p>
She gave a cry of wonder, and as she gazed at me,
her large black eyes dilated and flashed with anger.
</p>

<p>
"Basilia," said I, "do you not remember me?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied she, while trembling; "who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Osman, the son of Mostapha, your own Osman,
who saved you at Anapa."
</p>

<p>
"It is false," she answered, with eyes full of anger
and sorrow; "Osman was a brave Circassian warrior,
and I loved him; oh! how dearly and how well; but
he fell in battle at Mikhailov.  Thou art either a
base Muscovite, or some fiend in the shape of
Osman; a ghoul it may be, a son of Ifrit; begone, and
leave me."
</p>

<p>
I could have wept at these stinging words, which
sank like poisoned arrows in my heart, and I feared
that grief had disordered her intellects; but I did
injustice to Basilia, for her language was the first
prompting of honest grief and indignation to find me in the
uniform of the Tenginski Hussars, and false, as she
deemed, to my country and to her.  For so she told
me, when more composed, and when she heard my
story, as we sat side by side under a broad chesnut
tree with the plunder of the Turkish ship around us,
and the flames of its burning timbers to light our
little bivouac.  When we fired it, with all the
branches and withered leaves that were piled over it,
the flames burned bravely, and shot above the copse-wood,
as they licked the mast and its well-tarred cordage.
</p>

<p>
I sat at the feet of Basilia, my heart teemed with
joy, half the objects of existence seemed accomplished
now, and I could no longer believe that fortune had
greater favours in store for me.
</p>

<p>
In the language of our own beloved country, we
formed innumerable projects of happiness, or whispered
plans of escape from the toils of the Russians,
and I had resolved in the night, if possible, to elude
my own sentinels, to mount Basilia on Zupi, and to
depart by the vale of Mezip towards the wilderness
of mount Shapsucka, when my sergeant, with a dark
and singular expression in his eye, came to inform
me that my brother "the Lieutenant Selim was
nowhere to be found."
</p>

<p>
Karolyi, who was sitting beside us, looked up, and
gave a deep smile as the Cossack spoke.
</p>

<p>
In short, after seeing the last Turk cut down, Selim,
while our dismounted hussars were overhauling the
ship, had turned his horse's head towards the mountains
and escaped.
</p>

<p>
I rejoiced at this for a time.
</p>

<p>
"But brother Osman," said Karolyi, "Selim has
done us a wrong in this; we should all have fled
together, for thou and I will now be watched with
double suspicion, and have our simplest actions
subjected to the severest scrutiny."
</p>

<p>
"Remember, there is the maiden, whom I cannot
leave behind; so let us rejoice that Circassia has one
brave warrior more."
</p>

<p>
Karolyi made a gesture of impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Circassia," said he, "has maidens enough and to
spare; but for every warrior on her hills, she requires
at least a hundred.  This is no time for wedding or
acting the lover, for twangling on the lute and
kneeling on the verge of a pretty maid's carpet."
</p>

<p>
"These were my own words, Karolyi, when urged
by you and Selim to wed ere Schamyl rose in arms."
</p>

<p>
"True, brother, true," replied Karolyi, "and in
truth, this little maiden is a miracle of beauty.  My
soul and sword are at her service, command them;
but in the name of Merissa think not of escape
to-night.  Another and perhaps more favourable
opportunity may soon occur."
</p>

<p>
The night passed quickly away.  I watched Basilia
while she slept in my mantle.  I was sleepless, but
silent and happy, for my mind was full of love and
her.
</p>

<p>
Next day I placed her on Zupi, and we set out for
head-quarters amid the maledictions of the ten rescued
slaves, who saw all their anticipated delights of a
seraglio life suddenly cut short, and who knew that
fate would now consign them to high-cheeked Kalmucks,
or the rough, greasy Cossacks, in lieu of the
wealthy Osmanlis, the luxurious Pashas, and turbaned
Agas, whom they had hoped to have as masters; and
they consoled themselves by reviling me as a renegade,
and invoking on my head all the ills that fell on the
God-abandoned Thamudites, and on the offspring of
Saba, the son of Yarab.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at head-quarters, I presented my
prisoners, and the right ears of fifteen Turks to Colonel
Carlovitch.  The ears he flung to his dogs, and the
ten girls, not finding favour in the sight of the officers
who crowded about them, were given to Cossacks, to
make wives or whatever they pleased of them, for
such is the law of the Russian military colonies on
the Kuban; and to himself, despite my prior claim by
love and capture; despite my rage and grief, my
entreaties and ill-smothered threatenings&mdash;to
himself&mdash;this accursed Muscovite assigned Basilia as a
hand-maiden!
</p>

<p class="t3">

<p>
(Here the Circassian, who had related this part of
his narrative in short and broken sentences, paused,
and ground his teeth, while the veins of his fine pale
forehead swelled like rigid cords, and his keen dark
eyes became glazed with the ferocity, fire, and grief
that filled them.)

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
ZUPI.
</h3>

<p>
Ivan Carlovitch, he resumed, was a soldier
insensible alike to pity and to danger.  His cold and
rigid sternness had first brought him under the notice
of his imperial master, who raised him from the
humblest rank in the army.  He had a strict and
almost absurd idea of the implicit obedience which
should be rendered by the soldier to his superior;
and wild as I was then with passion and grief on
finding that I had only saved Basilia from one
degrading condition to deliver her over to one still more
cruel and terrible&mdash;to be the mistress, the plaything
of a wretched Russian&mdash;I had sufficient tact to see
that resistance would only serve to destroy my own
hopes of a dreadful vengeance, and of achieving her
freedom.  On the first symptom of disobedience,
Carlovitch would have brought me before a general
court-martial.  From this tribunal in Russia, the way
to the knout or the grave is short and rapid,
especially to a poor Pole, or a captive Tcherkesse warrior.
</p>

<p>
It is related that early in life, Ivan Carlovitch, the
son of Carl, a porter of Moscow, was a soldier in
General Ouchterlony's battalion of the Imperial
Guard, and was one day a sentinel on the private
gate of the palace at St. Petersburg, when a sudden
inundation of the Neva spread terror among the
inmates of the edifice, and forced them to retreat to the
upper stories.
</p>

<p>
The Empress Alexandrina was surveying the rising
waters from a balcony, when she perceived Carlovitch
standing at his post motionless, and mid leg in the
water.  In great alarm she desired him to retire
within doors.  He "presented arms" when Her
Majesty addressed him, but respectfully declined.  The
flood increased.  Trees were swept away, railings
and balustrades, vases of flowers, dead cattle, boats,
and logs of wood were surged and dashed against the
palace walls; again and again the Empress and her
ladies called in great agitation to the sentinel,
desiring him to abandon a post so perilous; but with
admirable coolness he replied, that he "dared not until
properly relieved or withdrawn by an order from the
captain of the guard."  That officer had by this time
clambered to the roof of the guard-house, from
whence he sent the corporal, a good swimmer, to
bring off this obstinate sentinel, who was now up to
his neck in water.
</p>

<p>
For this act of bravado or insensibility to danger,
Carlovitch was appointed a captain in the Infantry
Regiment of Tenginski, and marched with it against
the Circassians.  In due time he was appointed
colonel of the Tenginski Hussars (for there are two
corps, one of horse and the other of foot, so named),
and as such I found him when misfortune cast me in
his way.
</p>

<p>
He was a man without mercy, and often brought
his bravest soldiers to the knout for the most trivial
fault; but he never broke into gusts of passion, and
though constantly using among the soldiers, the serfs,
and prisoners a heavy rattan, every blow of which
brought away a stripe of flesh, he always addressed
them with a cold and cruel smile, which filled those
who knew him with fear and repugnance.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how I loathe his memory and the recollection
of that fiendish leer, which I can picture so distinctly
at this moment!
</p>

<p>
But what of Basilia, you would ask me?
</p>

<p>
Fain would I draw a veil over her fate; but a few
words will relate it.
</p>

<p>
The insulting advances, the bold declarations of a
love the most repugnant to a heart so pure, the
caresses and the presents of Carlovitch she received
with disdain.  For three days and three nights tears
were her only protection; entreaties for mercy her
only weapon; but at last even they failed her.  One
night Carlovitch, flushed with wine and fury on leaving
a banquet given by Prince Merischikoff, assailed
her in his own tent, and to escape him, the miserable
Basilia pierced her throat with a poniard, and died
at his feet!
</p>

<p>
Her pure, fair, beautiful form was wrapped in a
horse-rug, and buried by the rough hands of Cossack
pioneers, at the foot of a rock on the left bank of the
Kuban.
</p>

<p>
The grave of my love lay but a pistol shot distant
from the tent of her destroyer; yet his iron heart
never smote him, and never reproached him with his
cruelty; he smoked, he drank the wine of the
Tcherkesses, and played at cards and chess, and with his
brother officers sang as merrily as ever, and no more
regarded the death he had caused and the misery he
had wrought, than the ashes of his last cigar.
</p>

<p>
Where then was I?
</p>

<p>
Forced to lead my troop against my own people,
and watched by a chosen few of my own soldiers, I
had been sent towards Azov in pursuit of fugitive
Circassians.  One whom we had tracked the livelong
day, riding over steep mountains, through pathless
forests and deep rivers, was taken at nightfall by his
horse falling under him.  He was brought in, exhausted
with fatigue and faint with hunger, covered with blood,
with scars, brambles, and heavily fettered.  The poor
fugitive we had pursued so long, and taken at last,
proved to be my brother Selim, who had failed to
reach the camp of our confederated princes, and had
wandered long on the Russian side of Mount Shapsucka.
</p>

<p>
I was filled with new dismay.  It seemed that I
required but this to complete my misery.  I rent my
beard, and threw myself on the ground; I cursed
myself and Ivan Carlovitch in the same breath, and
daringly upbraided the Prophet with injustice to a
Mussulman so devout as I.
</p>

<p>
Poor Selim heard my words with terror.  He raised
me from the ground; he kissed me on both cheeks,
and besought me to be composed, and then we were
separated.  I had to continue my march towards the
shores of the sea of Azov, while Selim, the miserable
Selim, was dragged before Carlovitch, who tried him
as a deserter, had him degraded, and his sword and
commission trodden under foot; after which he was
sentenced to die&mdash;to die under the knout&mdash;"a terror
to other Tcherkesses who trifled with the service of
their beneficent lord and father the emperor."
</p>

<p>
Three weeks afterwards I heard of his fate, and to
nerve my soul for the coming vengeance, I drank in
the terrible description of the poor boy's dying scene.
I was told by my sergeant how the troops were
formed in a hollow square&mdash;ten thousand Russian
slaves, misnamed as soldiers, with bayonets fixed and
colours flying; I was told how the noble prisoner
stood amid them, with the kingly air of a true
Circassian cavalier, though stripped of every article of
attire, save a pair of tattered drawers; how he was
bound by the wrists, the neck, and ancles, to a large
gun-carriage, and how the executioner, a gigantic
Kalmuck, stood six feet distant to give his infernal
weapon a swing more full and heavy.  I was told how
Selim&mdash;for he was the youngest of us&mdash;screamed in
agony as each successive blow fell on his bare and
quivering shoulders, from which the flesh was torn in
pieces by every lash of the dreadful whip; how
between every stroke this giant Kalmuck dipped its
bloody ends in brimstone, and how the victim sank
beneath the strokes, until at last their sound came
dull and dead, for poor Selim had expired with four
words on his lips; they were, "My brothers&mdash;my
brothers."
</p>

<p>
I did not shed a tear for him; a fiend seemed to
possess me; a devilish joy swelled within me, as I
lay that night in the bivouac beside the feet of Zupi,
rolled in my mantle, with my sword and pistols at
my side.
</p>

<p>
"Woe to thee, whining cur of the Czar, woe!" I
repeated again and again; "to-morrow I will see
thee, Carlovitch&mdash;to-morrow shall thy soul answer to
heaven and to hell for these atrocities; and to-morrow
Mostapha's son shall cease to be the serf of this dog
Emperor, Nicholas Paulovitch!"
</p>

<p>
The sunny morrow came, and loud and shrill rang
the trumpets which summoned the Hussars and
Grenadiers of Tenginski to a general parade.  I
examined my saddle girths, my bridle, and my arms,
with scrupulous exactness, for this would be the last
parade I was ever to attend.  I threw away everything
that might serve to encumber my motions or
overload my horse, and by my advice Karolyi did the
same.
</p>

<p>
We were now with that portion of the Russian
army which had fallen back from the Circassian
Mountains to recruit and reform after their defeats
by Schamyl; and which, after recrossing the Don,
was cantoned principally in the Ukraine.  The
division to which we belonged occupied Poltava, one of
the richest and best parts of the adjoining province
for pasturing cavalry horses.
</p>

<p>
On the very day after we halted at Poltava, a grand
parade was formed before Prince Menschikoff, and as
I had marched with the baggage guard, I saw Carlovitch
for the first time since these atrocities had cast
a horror on my soul.  The Prophet alone knows
what were my emotions at the sight of him.  The
voices of Basilia and of Selim were rising from their
graves&mdash;they were ever in my ears whispering
"vengeance," and I rode amid the troops like one in a
stupor.  The parade was a magnificent one.
</p>

<p>
There were present the Imperial Guard, under
General Ouchterlony, a Scotsman, and his three sons,
all colonels of battalions; these men were the flower
of the Russian army; the six Grenadier battalions of
Prince Frederick of Hesse Phillipesthal; the veteran
regiment of Moscow, commanded by Prince Frederick
of Mecklenburg; the Cuirassiers of the Grand
Duchess Olga, and the gorgeous Hussars of the
Princess Maria Paulowna (sister of the Emperor),
whose trappings far eclipsed those of the two Tenginski
corps of Hussars and Infantry.  But Karolyi and
I laughed at the splendour of these idolaters, and
scorn grew with hatred in our hearts; for it is of
these, and such as these&mdash;eaters of hogs'-flesh and
drinkers of brandy&mdash;that our Prophet spoke, when he
said, "lo! they are like no other than brute cattle,"
and they shall perish like the people of Irem, of
Thamud, and those who, as the Koran tells us, dwelt
in al Rass.
</p>

<p>
The review passed before me like a dream, for my
mind was full of other thoughts, and I saw only the
mangled and bleeding body of Selim bound to the
field-piece, and the poor remains of Basilia asleep in
that uncouth grave where the Russian pioneers had
buried her, when suddenly my name resounded along
the glittering ranks; Carlovitch summoned me to the
front, when all the cavalry were formed in line to
deliver a general salute.
</p>

<p>
Something had gone wrong.  I know not what, but
I had neglected my troop when deploying from close
column into line, and Carlovitch, usually so grave and
impassible, was choking with passion.  He called me
"a dog of a Tcherkesse," and smote me on the face
with his rattan.
</p>

<p>
The blow went straight to my heart!
</p>

<p>
For a moment I felt as if a thunderbolt had struck
me; but transported with fury, I uttered the yell-like
war cry of Circassia, and buried my sharp sabre&mdash;the
noble steel of far-away Damascus&mdash;in his dastard
heart!
</p>

<p>
Again I thrust it to the hilt, as tottering he drooped
upon his holsters, dying and gushing of blood, and
then I spurned the corpse with my feet as it fell.  I
slew him on the spot, in the face of fifty thousand
men!  May the curse of mankind fall upon the turf
which wraps the dog who begot him!
</p>

<p>
I brandished my sabre, and shouted wildly to
Karolyi,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To the hills&mdash;away, away!  Tcherkesse!  Tcherkesse!"
</p>

<p>
Goring his horse with the spurs, he sprang from
the ranks, as the roar of a thousand voices ascended
from them, on witnessing this act of justice; together
we dashed at a furious pace towards the nearest
mountains, and had already placed a deep and rapid
torrent between us and the Russians, before they had
recovered from their astonishment, or made proper
arrangements for a pursuit.
</p>

<p>
The most accomplished rider in Europe is acknowledged
to sit his horse like a clown when contrasted
with a Circassian cavalier; and fortunate it was for
Karolyi and me, that we&mdash;both men and horses&mdash;were
bred and reared on the slopes of the Caucasus; as
we were hotly and fiercely pursued by relays of
mounted men despatched fresh and lightly accoutred
from the innumerable military posts we passed.  The
wild Tchernemorski Cossacks, with their long lances,
and wiry little horses; the Tenginski and Paulowna
Hussars, and even the heavy, helmeted, breast-plated
and jack-booted Olga cuirassiers spurred after us; but
among the deep rocky gorges, the tangled brakes, the
shifting mosses, and the fordless rivers, we soon rid
ourselves of the latter, and most of the others, save
the Cossacks, who followed us like spirits of evil,
unrelenting and unwearying, for many a day and many
a night.
</p>

<p>
In desperate hope to reach the Prussian frontier, we
had already crossed the Dnieper, and traversed the
palatinate of Minsk, where for days we rode over a
flat country, of which we were ignorant, and where,
in despair, we were frequently about to abandon the
hope of escape, when we found ourselves involved in
the mazes of a wild forest and dreary morass that lie
on the banks of its rivers.  But our native hardihood
preserved us; for a cleft in a rock, or the branch of a
tree with a sword for a pillow, is home enough at any
time for a Tcherkesse warrior.
</p>

<p>
However, we now began to experience a serious
difficulty in procuring a knowledge of the route to be
pursued.  We knew little of the language; our aspect
was jaded, wan, and terrible; our uniform hung about
us in rags; our horses were sinking, and that we
were deserters was evident to every observer.  And
now the people of Lithuania joined in the pursuit,
and one evening, just as we were about to cross a
river named the Swislocz, our Tchernemorski Cossacks
came upon us, and their wild shout of joy at the
termination of that flight, which to them had been a
long and exciting chase, rang in the air above us,
as they reined up their horses on the rocks that
overhung the stream, and brandished their spears.
</p>

<p>
We were about to plunge in, when one more bold
or more freshly mounted than his comrades, wounded
Karolyi by a lance thrust.
</p>

<p>
"May demons defile thy beard, and their plagues
fall on thee and thine!" exclaimed my brother in a
gust of fury; but now he had dropped or broken every
weapon save his dagger, so with that quickness which
is peculiar to the Circassian, he dismounted, rushed
upon the Cossack's horse, drove the weapon into its
breast, and bearing it back at the same time by the
bridle, he hurled the snorting steed over upon its
rider, and crushed him to death in an instant.
</p>

<p>
Vaulting again into his own well-worn saddle, he
plunged with me into the stream, and gallantly we
breasted it&mdash;while the carbines of the Tchememorski
Cossacks&mdash;the only soldiers in the Russian service
who can at all compete with our people&mdash;rang on
every side, as they commenced a simultaneous
discharge upon us, and their bullets flattened on the
rocks, or raised incessant water-spouts around us.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I heard a low cry and a choking gurgle
that filled my heart with misery.  I looked back;
Karolyi, struck by a bullet, had sunk from his saddle,
and a spurred boot alone was visible, as horse and
rider was swept over a cataract, and borne away
towards the Dnieper.
</p>

<p>
So perished my second brother!
</p>

<p>
Forcing Zupi up a bank where the reeds grew at
least twelve feet high, I still rode recklessly on; but
brave as they were, not one of the Cossacks dared to
cross that foaming torrent in pursuit.  Night came
down to shroud my flight; there was no moon.  I
reached a wood, and flung myself down exhausted in
mind and body.  I was now dead to the fear of
discovery, and I cared not for wolves, or other wild
animals.
</p>

<p>
The presence of Karolyi, his companionship and
our brotherly love, had alone sustained me thus far;
now he was gone, and I was alone in the world; but
there was at least one consolation: he had died the
death of a warrior, with one hand on his bridle, and
the other on his weapon; he had fallen, like his
father's son, in battle with the enemies of his country,
but he had found a tomb far from his father's grave,
and far from the banks of the Kisselbash River.
</p>

<p>
Three days I lay without food, save a little wild
honey, and without repose in that Lithuanian forest,
and careless whether I lived or died; for want, misery,
privation and mental agony had broken my spirit, and
destroyed alike every purpose, hope, and reflection.
There I prayed to the only Prophet of God, and
remembered with growing trust that in the blessed
Koran, he enjoins us to seek aid with perseverance;
and I implored him to deliver me, even as the Lord
divided the sea of Kolzom with his hand to let his
people pass, and thereafter drowned the Egyptian
host; and the Prophet heard me; for even while I
prayed with my bare head in the dust, there chanced
to pass that way a poor Tartar who dwelt on the
skirts of the forest, and who had come hither to cut
wood.
</p>

<p>
He heard me address the Prophet, and remembering
the faith of his fathers, felt his heart moved within
him; so he had compassion upon me, and took me
to his hut, which, like all the Tartar dwellings, was
little better than a rabbit-hole, burrowed on the face
of a hill, with a rude verandah in front.  Fortunately
it lay in a wild and secluded place; so I dwelt for
some days in safety with this good man, who guided
me across the plains of Grodno, until I passed the
Prussian frontier, when I knelt with my face to the
east, and gave thanks to Heaven&mdash;thanks that I was
safe from Russia, although eight hundred miles lay
between me and the hills of my beloved Circassia.
</p>

<p>
Zupi, my horse, the noble animal which had borne
me this incredible distance, was my first care, and to
procure new garments in lieu of the tattered uniform
of the Tenginski Hussars was the second; and
intent only on reaching Britain, which was about to
declare war against Russia, I travelled through part
of Prussia by railway, a mode of locomotion, which I
there saw for the first time, and which filled me with
wonder and awe.
</p>

<p>
On reaching that kingdom, I thought my troubles
were at an end; but there, alas!  I found myself
accused of a murder, stripped of the little sum I had
about me, separated from Zupi, cast into prison, and
in danger of being hanged; or what was worse, sent
back to the Russian General Todleben, who
commanded at Grodno.  It happened thus.
</p>

<p>
I travelled towards Dantzig in a second-class
carriage, in which the only other passenger was a pale
and careworn young man, whose profusion of beard,
braided coat, and small cap, with its square peak, gave
him somewhat the aspect of a student.  Taciturn and
thoughtful, and being full of astonishment at the
speed with which we swept over plain and valley,
across rivers and under mountains&mdash;travelling as it
were on the skirts of a whirlwind&mdash;I did not address
my companion, who after smoking a large pipe for
some time, covered his head with his cloak, and threw
himself at full length along the seat, where he lay,
long, as I thought, asleep.  A jolt of the train threw
him on the floor, and perceiving that he lay motionless
and still, I hastened to lift him; but how great
was my emotion, to find my hands covered with blood&mdash;for
this silent fellow-passenger was a suicide, who
had cut his throat from ear to ear, by a knife, which
he grasped in his now rigid hand.
</p>

<p>
I endeavoured to lower the windows, but I knew
not the way; so I dashed one to pieces, and cried
aloud to the guards or drivers&mdash;I know not which you
name them; but I was unheeded, and still this
apparently infernal vehicle, in which I was enclosed
with the bloody corpse, swept on, screaming, whistling,
jarring, clanking, smoking, and whirling over
wood and plain, over the roofs of towns, past the
weathercocks of churches, and the tops of lofty trees,
with a speed and din that would have carried terror
and dismay to the hearts of a Circassian host, and
would have swept Kurds and Kalmucks to the furthest
confines of Asia.
</p>

<p>
At Dantzig the train arrived in due time, and the
doors were opened by the conductors.  I was found
with "the murdered man;" my recent cries were
attributed to him; the broken windows to his dying
struggle, for my hands were cut and covered with
blood!  The Prussian gallows threatened me on one
hand and the Russian knout upon the other.  I was
a poor unfriended foreigner, in a land of spies,
suspicion, and police agents; and in my own defence
had not one word to urge, for I was ignorant of the
language.  But fortunately next day, a letter was
found on the person of the deceased, who proved to
be a French artist, announcing his intention of
destroying himself, and adding, that "when he had no
longer a sou, it was thus a Frenchman should
die&mdash;Vive la France!  Vive le diable!"
</p>

<p>
This relieved me, and explained the whole affair;
but the Prussian gens-d'armes kept my purse, as they
said, to pay "all contingencies;" and had not the
captain of a large French ship taken pity upon me, and
brought me and my horse to London&mdash;the capital of
Europe&mdash;I must have begged for bread in the streets
of Dantzig, and had to sell my beloved Zupi to save
the noble animal from starvation.
</p>

<p>
Finding myself in the great city of London, I was
likely to be in greater distress than when in the vast
forest of Lithuania; for in London the whole population
live in an atmosphere of snares, suspicion, and
mistrust, every man viewing his neighbour as one who
has a design upon him.  Again I was starving, for
the little sum with which the French captain supplied
me was spent upon Zupi, by whose side I always
slept at night in an old cart-shed.  But remembering
that by birth and habit I was a soldier, I applied to
the officers of the Household Brigade; some of these
smiled, and shook their heads doubtfully, until Sir
Henry Slingsby laid before them my commission in
the Tenginski Hussars; it was fringed with silver,
and signed by the Emperor Nicholas Paulovitch.
Then they had a fellow feeling for me, and treated
me with a kindness, the memory of which fills my
soul with gratitude; for never, to the last hour of my
life, shall I forget it, or omit to pray for the good and
brave Ingleez.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
WE REACH HEAD-QUARTERS.
</h3>

<p>
Such was the story of the Circassian captain, and it
occupied the greater part of the time during which
the San Lucar packet steamed along the south-west
coast of Andalusia, passing Cape Plata, and entering
the Straits of Gibraltar, had rounded the promontory
which is crowned by towers and ramparts of Tarifa,
after which a run of seventeen miles brought us into
the harbour of the great rock, where the babble of
Spaniards, Moors, Italians, French, and Gitanas was
ringing in our ears again, as we landed with our
horses on the quay.
</p>

<p>
Taking our new friend with us&mdash;for we could not
but have a lively interest in a brother patriot of the
valiant Schamyl&mdash;the Washington of the Caucasus,
the Wallace of Circassia, we repaired at once to
headquarters, and related the success of our visit to Seville,
reserving future relations until we went to mess in
the evening.
</p>

<p>
We introduced Captain Osman Rioni to Morton,
our colonel, who immediately spoke to him of service
in the Turkish Contingent, urging it upon him the
more vehemently, as there were then in the harbour
six transports full of French and British troops en
route to Sebastopol.  But Osman thanked the good
colonel, and shook his head, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mohammed was the first Prophet of God, and
the holy Murid Schamyl is the second!  Our destiny
is written on our foreheads; may it be mine to die in
the ranks of war!  Every man hath his part in life
allotted to him; may it be mine to fight for my
country, and fight again I shall!  Is not her blood
red on the Russian bayonets?  I will carry a lance
under no flag but the green Sangiac Sheerif of
Circassia.  Would to heaven I saw it now with the twelve
stars of the confederated tribes, for then I should see
the Abassian peaks and the wilds of Daghestan, the
warriors in their mail of links, and the linden trees
that shade those cottage doors from which our women
bless us, and we ride to war against the Buss.  Yes,
yes; I will return to Circassia on her shore alone to
fight with Schamyl against the foes of God, and to
see once more the snowy rocks of Elbrus, where
the ark of Noah first rested before it lay on Ararat."
</p>

<p>
His story, his peculiar language and bearing, his
horse Zupi, and his love for that gallant animal made
him quite a seven days' wonder with "Ours," and he
was the lion of the mess table.  Every one who had
any pretension to be a connoisseur in horse-flesh had
visited, criticised, and caressed Zupi, which was a
long-bodied, wiry, and, to our taste, somewhat short-legged
nag, with small ears, a noble head, full chest
and flanks, compact and close.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred times and more he has stood still as
a stone wall, and allowed me to fire my long Albanian
gun between his ears, using his head as a rest," said
Osman; "courage, brave Zupi&mdash;courage!  Ere long
thou shalt snuff the air in woody Daghestan, and
drink of the foaming Koissons."
</p>

<p>
We raised a handsome subscription for him in one
night at our mess table, and procured him a passage
in a French cavalry transport; so he left us, with lips
that quivered as he said "farewell," and a heart that
yearned with gratitude.  He said that one day
we should hear of him when Schamyl and his
host marched towards the shores of the Sea of
Azov.
</p>

<p>
Whether Osman reached his own wild and war-like
country we have yet to learn; for since the day
on which the "Napoleon III." steamed away past the
New Mole fort, with her deck crowded by Zouaves,
and our Circassian among them waving his red cap
in adieu to us, we have heard no more of him; for
the tidings of the Caucasian strife that reach Europe
are meagre, doubtful, and vague, as those that came
from the Holy Land of old.
</p>

<p>
Slingsby and I were complimented in garrison
orders for the manner in which we had accomplished
our little diplomatic trip to Seville, and were praised
for the dangers we had encountered and escaped.
</p>

<p>
Our adventures, with those of Osman Rioni,
infected the mess with a desire to "spin yarns," and
the result was, that from being the most matter-of-fact
fellows in the world, every one of "Ours" had a
romantic story to tell.
</p>

<p>
"Now, gentlemen," said the colonel, one evening
when I had brought my narrative down to the happy
epoch of our embarkation on board the steamer at
San Lucar de Barameda, "how much more pleasant
and entertaining has all this been to us than the
usual absurd chit-chat which reigns supreme at a
mess table; the everlasting quiz about the curl of
Ramble's mustachios; the banter about Bob's whiskers,
or Slingsby's bay mare, and how Shafton craned
at the hedge in the steeple-chase; the odds on the
Derby; the last new singer; the latest ballet
importation, with the shape of her ancles, and so forth;
the last novel or polka, or belle, or piece of humbug;
now is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
Hereupon all those whose constant topics the
colonel had just enumerated, warmly assented that it
was, and that the narrative had proved immensely
interesting.
</p>

<p>
"Deuced instructive, too!" yawned the most stupid
fellow at the table.
</p>

<p>
"Might spin three volumes out of it, Ramble.
'Men and Manners in Andalusia!'" said another.
</p>

<p>
"No banter now, gentlemen!" said the colonel;
"pass the bottles, Shafton.  Mr. Vice-President, another
allowance of wine; I have a proposal to make.  We
have been&mdash;that is, the most of us&mdash;have been in all
the quarters of the globe, and have seen life in all its
phases and varieties.  Therefore, I beg to move that
each of us who has a story to tell should forthwith
tell it for the amusement of the mess, under the
penalty of a dozen of wine."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo," said every one.
</p>

<p>
"I beg to second the motion," said Jack Slingsby.
</p>

<p>
"With an amendment," added Shafton, "that the
colonel should tell the first story himself, the said
amendment to be inserted in the minutes of the mess
committee."
</p>

<p>
It was carried unanimously, amid much fun and
laughter.
</p>

<p>
Our colonel, who is a fine, frank, and brave-hearted
old fellow, had no idea that he was so suddenly to find
himself in his own trap.  He laughed and reflected a
little, as he stroked the wiry, grey mustache which, in
compliance with the late general order, he had just
begun to cultivate after forty years of close shaving;
and then he smoothed his thin white hair, for he was
an old soldier, and (but for the favouritism of the
Horse Guards) would have been a general twenty
years ago, being one of the few survivors of that army
which gave battle to France on the shores of Aboukir,
where, as he was wont to say, "he had carried the
colours of Geordie Moncrief's lambs&mdash;the old
Perthshire Greybreeks."  He had also been through the
whole Peninsular war, and served in the Fifth Hussars,
with Sir Colquhoun Grant's brigade under Wellington
in Flanders.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen much in my time, gentlemen," said
he, good humouredly, as he tossed off a glass of
claret, "but have no adventures of my own to relate&mdash;at
least none that are at all worth your attention.  I
can, however, tell you the story of another, whose
scrapes were somewhat remarkable, and were in some
respects&mdash;as far as Spanish robbers were concerned&mdash;like
those of Ramble and Jack Slingsby.  They were
told me by a French officer, a gay fellow, but a
regular candle-snuffer at twelve paces, whom I met at
Paris when the allies were there; by this you will
perceive that the affairs I refer to happened many a
year ago."
</p>

<p>
The glasses were filled; the cracking of nuts
ceased; the heavy crystal decanters were slid
noiselessly over the long smooth mess-table, the
well-polished surface of which reflected the red coats
around it, and all was hushed as our grave and
gentle old colonel began the following narrative, to
which I beg leave to devote my next three chapters.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
ST. FLORIDAN; OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
The night was dark, and the lamps of the Rue du
Temple had nearly all been extinguished by a high
wind; there was no moon visible.
</p>

<p>
It was in the month after the capture of Paris, in
1815, that the adventures I am about to relate
occurred.
</p>

<p>
The defeat at Waterloo, the rapid advance of the
British troops, the capture of Cambray by Sir Charles
Colville, of Peronne, by the Brigade of Guards under
Major-General Maitland, and, last of all, the seizure
and military occupation of the great and glorious city
of Paris&mdash;the citadel of Napoleon&mdash;the heart of
France, had exasperated the French, and excited
their animosity against us.  Every citizen greeted us
with darkened brows and lowering eyes.
</p>

<p>
No officer of the allied army could pass through
the streets of Paris in perfect safety without being
armed, and few went abroad from their billets or
cantonments after nightfall, unless in small parties
of three or four, for mutual protection.  On many
occasions we were openly insulted and severely
maltreated in the more solitary streets or meaner suburbs
of the city; while in the taverns and restaurateurs
our quarrels were frequent with the old men of the
Revolution, who had witnessed the decapitation of
Louis, and the demolition of the Bastile; but still
more so with the soldiers of Buonaparte, who were
swarming in every part of Paris, in plain clothes, or
in the rags and remnants of their uniform.
</p>

<p>
Those French officers whom we met at the promenades,
on the Boulevards, in the Jardin des Plantes,
at the theatres, or in the salons and billiard rooms,
sought quarrels with us quite as frequently as their
men; but these, of course, ended in hostile
rencontres, and for the first weak or two a morning
seldom passed without a French, or British, or
Prussian officer being borne dead, or wounded,
through a mocking crowd at the barriers, from the
Bois de Boulogne.
</p>

<p>
In all these wanton quarrels and street assaults the
republicans eminently distinguished themselves, and
often vented their pitiful spleen by spitting at us
from the windows; by hissing and railing at us
in language that would have disgraced the denizens
of the infamous faubourg St. Antoine; but after
a time, when it became generally known that their
great emperor had surrendered himself to Captain
Maitland, of the Bellerophon, and submitted to the
clemency of Britain, their virulence abated, and their
manner became somewhat changed towards us:
though their hatred of the Russian troops, sharpened
by the bitter memories of the retreat from Moscow,
was undying and inextinguishable.
</p>

<p>
It is an old story now; but Lord Wellington had
taken every means to insure the tranquillity of the
city, and to repress any armed outbreak, which must
assuredly have ended in its utter destruction; for the
Black Eagle of Hapsburg soared above Montmartre,
and the Union of Britain waved over the splendid
garden, the winding walks, and leafy groves of the
Champs Elysées; the brass cannon of Blucher were
planted at every barrier-gate, loaded with grape and
canister, to rake the streets at a moment's notice;
while by night and by day, his artillerists, in their
blue great coats and bearskin caps, remained by their
guns, with swords drawn and matches lighted.  A
regiment of Scottish Highlanders occupied the
Tuileries; the Prussian advanced guard was in
position on the road to Orleans, cutting off the
remnant of the French army who had survived the
18th of June, and still obeying the baton of Davoust,
were lingering on the banks of the Loire.  Every
approach to Paris was guarded by our infantry, and a
strong division of the Allies were encamped in the
Wood of Boulogne, and along the right bank of the
Seine, so far as St. Ouen.
</p>

<p>
Never was Paris, the glory of France, more
completely humbled since Henry of England unfurled
his banner on its walls!
</p>

<p>
My regiment, the Fifth Hussars, were in the third,
or Sir Colquhoun Grant's cavalry brigade.  We were
quartered at Ligny, a small town on the Marne, about
fifteen miles from Paris, where we occupied the
ancient Benedictine monastery, which had been
founded in the eighth century by St. Fursi, a Scot, as
the old curé of the place informed me; and there,
with an irreverence for which the public utility, the
chances of war, and the orders of the quartermaster-general
must plead our excuse, we stabled our horses
in the church, and stored our rations and forage in
the chapel of Our Lady of Compassion.
</p>

<p>
It was while matters at Paris were in the state
I have described, that I obtained leave from parade
one day, hooked on my pelisse and sabre, and rode
from Ligny to visit the city of sunshine and gaiety,
bustle and smoke, music and wine, intending to
return to my billet, which was in the house of the
curé near the bridge over the Marne.
</p>

<p>
I was in time to see the Russians reviewed by the
Emperor Alexander, and passed the day very agreeably,
visiting the Champ de Mars, the Tuileries, where
the soldiers in the garb of old Gaul were keeping
guard, as in the days of the Ancient Alliance; the
site of the Bastile, the Hotel des Invalides, where
many an old soldier of the Empire saluted me with
more of sternness than respect in their aspect: the
temple where the hapless Louis had been confined,
and the noble gallery of the Louvre, on the lofty
walls of which were many a blank where the officers
of the Allied army had torn down and conveyed
away the artistic spoils of their several nations&mdash;spoils
wrested from every city in Europe by the
invading armies of Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
I dined at a restaurateur's on a beefsteak à l'Anglais
and kickshaws, a bottle of tent dashed with brandy,
and walked forth to enjoy a cigar on the Boulevards,
where several of our bands from the Champs Elysées,
and those of the Austrians from Montmartre, were
playing divinely for the amusement of the thousands
crowding those magnificent promenades, which, as all
the world knows, or ought to know, encircle the good
city of Paris, and were shaded by many a stately
plane and lime tree, that was levelled to form the
barricades of the last revolution.
</p>

<p>
There were the officers of the Allies in all uniforms,
the scarlet of Britain, the white of Austria, the blue
of Prussia, and the green of Russia, with all the
varieties of their different branches of service, horse,
foot, artillery, and rifles; Calmucks, Tartars, Scots,
Highlanders, and English guardsmen, jostling and
mingling among moustachioed students of l'Ecole de
Medicine, French priests in their long plain surtouts
and white collars, and Parisian dandies in their puckered
trousers, short frock coats, and little hats; while
the ladies, seated on camp stools, formed each the
centre of a circle, in which revolved a little world of
wit and chat and laughter; and the vendors of cigars,
of bon-bons, hot coffee, and iced lemonade, pushed
their way and a brisk trade through the crowd
together.
</p>

<p>
I had tired of all this, and was thinking of my
fifteen miles ride back to Ligny, through a rural
district to which I was a stranger, though I had my
sabre and pistols, and luckily the latter had been
loaded by my groom.  Nine o'clock was tolling from
the steeples of Paris; the crowds on the Boulevards
were dispersing; the bands had all played the old
Bourbon anthem, 'Vive Henri Quatre!' and with the
troops had repaired to their several cantonments.
The trumpets of the Austrians had pealed their last
night call from Montmartre, and the English drums
from the Champs Elysées, and the shrill Scottish
pipes from the Tuileries had replied to them.  The
lighted portfires of the Prussian artillery were
beginning to gleam at the barriers.  The streets were
becoming deserted and still.
</p>

<p>
Turning down the Rue du Temple, as I have
stated, from the Boulevard St. Martin, I endeavoured
to make my way to the stables of the hotel where I
had left my horse.
</p>

<p>
The darkness had increased very much, and the oil
lamps in the thoroughfares were few and far between,
and creaked mournfully in concert with many a
signboard as they swung to and fro to the full extent of
the cords by which they were suspended in the
centre of the way.
</p>

<p>
Aware that the streets of Paris were then far from
safe after nightfall, and that the knife of the assassin
was used as adroitly within sound of the bells of
Notre Dame as on the banks of the Ebro&mdash;with my
furred pelisse buttoned up, and my sabre under my
arm, I hurried on, anxious to avoid all rencontres
with chevaliers d'industrie and other vagrants, who
from time to time, by the occasional light of the
swinging lanterns, I could perceive lurking in the
shadows of porches and projections of the ancient
street.
</p>

<p>
I soon became aware that two of these personages
were dogging or accompanying me, on the opposite
side of the way; increasing their pace if I quickened
mine, and lingering when I halted or stepped short.
Anxious to avoid brawls, for on that point the orders
of the Duke of Wellington were alike stringent and
severe, I continued to walk briskly forward, keeping a
sharp eye to my two acquaintances, whose dusky
figures seemed like shadows gliding along the opposite
wall, for the cold and high night-wind had extinguished
so many of the oil lanterns, that some of the
streets branching off from the Boulevard du Temple
and the Rue St. Martin, were involved in absolute
darkness and gloom.
</p>

<p>
I was somewhat perplexed after wandering for
a considerable distance, to find myself on the margin
of the Seine, which jarred against its quays, flowing
on like a dark and waveless current, in which the
twinkling lights of the Quai de Bourbon, and the
gigantic shadows of the double towers of the church
of Notre Dame were reflected.
</p>

<p>
My followers had disappeared; but my uneasiness
was no way diminished, being well aware that the
clank of my spurs might mark my whereabouts;
and I was conscious that the gorgeously-laced hussar
pelisse and jacket of the Fifth were more than
enough to excite cupidity.  I shrunk back from the
Seine, on thinking of the ghastly Morgue (with its
rows of naked corpses spread like fish on leaden
trays), and the five francs given by the police of
Paris for every body found in the river at daybreak.
</p>

<p>
A low whistle made me start.
</p>

<p>
I turned round, and at that moment received a
blow from a bludgeon, which would infallibly have
fractured my left temple, had not my thick fur cap,
with its long scarlet kalpeck, saved me.  I reeled, and
immediately found myself seized by four ruffians,
who flung themselves upon me, and endeavoured
to pinion my arms, and wrench from me my sabre,
while they dragged me towards the edge of the Quai
de la Grève.
</p>

<p>
Strong, young, active, and exasperated, I struggled
with them desperately, and succeeded in obtaining
the hilt of my sabre, which I immediately unsheathed,
for the fellow who had been endeavouring to drag it
from my belt, grasped it by the sheath only; and an
instant sufficed to level him on the pavement, with
his jaw cloven through, and there he lay, yelling with
rage and pain, and blaspheming in the style of the
Faubourg St. Antoine.  Upon this his companions
fled.
</p>

<p>
Solitary as the quay had appeared, the cries of the
wounded bravo brought around me a swarm of vagrants
from house stairs, from nooks in the parapets
of the Pont Notre Dame, and from all the various
holes and corners, where they had been nestling for
the night, or hiding from the patrols of the
gensd'armes; and recognising me at once as an officer of
that detested Allied army, which had swept their
vast host from the plains of Waterloo, and prostrated
the eagle and tricolour, they assailed me with every
epithet of opprobrium that hatred and malice could
suggest; and there was an almost universal shout of
"A la lanterne! à la lanterne!" in which, no doubt,
my first assailants joined; and immediately I saw a
lamp descend, as the cord was unfastened from the
wall of the street, and lowered for my especial
behoof.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed and exasperated by the danger and insult
with which I was menaced, I endeavoured to break
through the press, by threateningly brandishing my
sabre, but though the circle around me widened, still
I was encompassed at every step, and made the
mark at which a pitiless shower of mud, stones, and
abuse poured without a moment's cessation.
</p>

<p>
While some cried "à la lanterne!" others shouted
for the gensd'armes and accused me of murder.  I
could perceive, to my no small concern, that the
knave I had cut down lay motionless upon the
pavement; and most unpleasant ideas floated before me,
that even if I escaped immolation at the hands of
these enraged Parisians, I might have to encounter
the greater humiliation and graver terrors of
Monsieur le Duc de Quiche&mdash;the Cour Royale de Paris&mdash;the
Chamber of Appeals&mdash;the Correctional Police,
and heaven only knew what more.
</p>

<p>
At this perplexing crisis, a young French officer,
in the scarlet uniform of the Garde du Corps of
Louis XVIII., broke through the crowd, exclaiming.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Halt! hold&mdash;in the name of the king&mdash;down
with you, insolent citizens!  Is it thus you treat our
allies?  Nom d'un Pape! but I will sabre the first
that lays a finger upon him.  Permit me&mdash;this way,
Monsieur Officier;" and he put his arm through mine.
</p>

<p>
We were now in a low quarter of the city; the
crowd of squalid wretches was increasing around us
every moment; lights flashed at the opened windows
of the neighbouring houses, and I could perceive the
glittering bayonets, and the great cocked hats of a
sergeant and six gensd'armes hurrying along the
lighted quay, either to my rescue or capture, but
which was dubious, for the vagabond women and
rag-pickers continued to yell incessantly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Arrest! arrest!&mdash;seize the English murderer! away
with him to the concierge!"
</p>

<p>
My heart beat quick; but my new friend of the
Garde du Corps seemed to be quite 'au fait' in
the management of such affairs, by the admirable
tact and decision he displayed.  Calling lustily for
the gensd'armes, he suddenly grasped half-a-dozen
of the foremost men in succession, and rapidly&mdash;for
he was a powerful fellow, threw them in a heap over
the wounded man, thus increasing the tumult, the
rage, and the confusion.
</p>

<p>
Then seizing me by the hand, he said hurriedly,
"Monsieur will pardon me&mdash;but come this way, or
you will be torn to pieces!" and half leading, half
dragging me, he conveyed me down a dark and
narrow street.  "Nom d'un Pape!  I could not see
a brother of the epaulette maltreated by these rascally
citizens," he continued, laughing heartily at the rage
and confusion of the bourgeois.  "Ha! ha! follow
me!  I know how to escape.  There are deuced few
outlets, holes or corners, byeways or sallyports in
Paris, that I don't know.  Ah corboeuf! didn't they
all tumble delightfully over like so many ninepins?
Ha! ha! but hark! they follow us.  Hasten with
me, Monsieur Officier, and remember that a brawl in
this neighbourhood may prove infinitely more
dangerous to you than to me."
</p>

<p>
I was too well aware of that to resist his guidance
and advice; and having no ambition to suffer, like
St. Stephen, at the hands of a mob, or (escaping
that) to figure next morning before the correctional
police, and in the evening endure a reprimand from
Wellington, I fairly turned, and, accompanying my
guide, ran at full speed along the dark alley,
laughing heartily at the affair.  Gathering like a
snowball, as it rolled along, the multitude came on,
puffing and shouting, and swearing and yelling
behind us.
</p>

<p>
"This way," cried my guide, who laughed
uproariously, and seemed one of the merriest fellows
imaginable; "this way&mdash;Vive la joie! we are all
right now!"
</p>

<p>
"Where are you leading me, in the name of all
that is miraculous?" I exclaimed, as my companion,
laying violent hands upon my sash, almost dragged
me down a flight of steps, which apparently led into
the bowels of the earth.  The appearance of the
vast depth to which they descended being increased
by a few hazy oil lamps that twinkled at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Monsieur," said I; "what the mischief&mdash;'t
is a strange den this!  I will go no further!"
</p>

<p>
"Courage, mon brave! courage! why we have
only descended about a hundred steps or so;"
replied the Frenchman, still continuing to descend.
"You will find this an old and odd place too; but
if you would escape an enraged rabble, the claws of
the police, the maison de force, the prison, and the
devil, follow me, and trust to my honour.  I am
Antoine St. Florian, Captain of the Garde du Corps,
and late of the 23rd Grenadiers under the Emperor.
You are safe&mdash;I know every nook in this subterranean
world, for I have found a shelter in its ample
womb many a time before to-night."
</p>

<p>
He still continued to speak as he descended, but
the sound of his voice became lost in the vast space
of the hollow vaults; my curiosity was excited: I
still kept my sabre drawn, prepared for any sudden
surprise or act of treachery, and continued to descend
some hundred steps, to a depth which I afterwards
ascertained to be 860 feet.
</p>

<p>
"This way, Monsieur; on&mdash;on yet!" exclaimed
my conductor, hurrying me forward through a gloomy
vault, and at that moment I heard the uproar of the
multitude, and the buzz of their mingled voices
resounding afar off, and high above us at the mouth of
the lofty staircase.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of the place in which I so suddenly
found myself was so strange, so novel, so grotesquely
horrible, that for some moments I was unable to
speak, and gazed about me in astonishment.  The
whole place seemed hewn out of the solid rock, and
the height of its roof was about twelve feet from the
floor, which was uniformly paved.  In every direction
caverns were seen branching off lighted by lamps
which vanished away in long lines of perspective
till they seemed to twinkle and expire amid the
noxious and foggy vapours of this wonderful place,
which appeared like a vast subterranean city, or the
work of enchantment.  The atmosphere was cold as
that of a winter day, and I was sensible of the utmost
difficulty of respiration.
</p>

<p>
Myriads of human skulls, grim, bare, and fleshless,
with grinning jaws and eyeless sockets, piles
of human bones, gaunt arms and jointed thighs,
basket-like ribs and ridgy vertebræ, were ranged in
frightful mockery along the sides of the vaulted
alleys or avenues of this subterranean city of Death.
The ghastly taste of some grim artist had arrayed all
these poor emblems of mortality in the form of
columns with capitals and arcades of intertwisted
arches, but from every angle of which the bare jaws
grinned, and the empty sockets looked drearily down
upon us, producing an effect that, when viewed by
the dim and uncertain light of the oil lamps, was
alike wondrous and terrible.  I was now in the
Catacombs of Paris, that place of which I had heard so
much.
</p>

<p>
To me, who had but recently left the Peninsula,
the appearance of these remnants of the men of other
years was less striking than it would prove to
visitors generally; for many a time and oft, I had
bivouacked where the dead of France and Britain lay
unburied; and I thought of Albuera and the plains
of Salamanca, where we had encamped within twelve
months after battles had been fought there&mdash;and
pitched our tents and lighted our camp fires on
ground strewn, for miles and miles, with the
half-buried skeletons of the brave who had fallen there,
producing an effect that was never to be effaced from
the memory.  There the triumphs of death were
calculated to impress the mind with melancholy; but
here it was too grotesquely grim and horrible.
</p>

<p>
Scraps of verses from Ovid, Virgil, and Anacreon,
appeared over the entrances of these caverns or
crypts, in gilt letters that glimmered through the
gloom; while, with a strange incongruity, but in true
keeping with the morbid taste of the French, large
red and yellow bills, the advertisements of the
theatres, the fashionable hotels, concerts, and tailors,
&amp;c., appeared on different parts of the walls.
</p>

<p>
At a little distance there bubbled up a sparkling
fountain, the plash of which rang hollowly in the
vast vaults, as it fell into a large basin, where a
number of gold fish were swimming.  Over it shone
the legend, in gilded letters&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "THIS IS THE WATER OF OBLIVION."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"They are strange and frightful places, these
Catacombs, Monsieur St. Florian," said I.
</p>

<p>
"True, mon ami," he replied, pausing to take
breath; "but famous for the growth of asthmatic
coughs, and all diseases of the lungs.  Peste!  What
an uproar these bourgeois make.  The affair has
quite sobered me, for I was somewhat unsteady
before.  My face is scratched, I think.  Does it
seem so?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather."
</p>

<p>
"Mille baionettes! do you say so? and I shall
be for guard to-morrow at the chateau&mdash;and with
this swollen face.  Morbleu! what will the ladies
think?"
</p>

<p>
"I regret very much, Monsieur le Capitaine, that
for me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pho! my dear fellow, no apologies; I care not
a sous about it," said my new friend, whom I could
now see to be a tall and handsome fellow, whose
scarlet uniform, faced and lapelled with blue, fitted
him to admiration.  His face was prepossessing in
its contour, and was very much "set off," or
enhanced, by his sparkling dark eyes, his jet
moustache, and smart red forage-cap; but he had quite
the air of a 'roué,' and the unmistakable bearing of
a man about town.  "Ha! ha!" he continued, "how
messieurs the bourgeois were rolled over each other;
that was indeed a coup de grace&mdash;the trick of an
old routier!  Ah! 't was poor Jacques Chataigneur
taught me that."
</p>

<p>
"How hollow our voices sound in these vaults,"
said I, after a pause; for the Frenchman's merry
tones and light remarks seemed strange to me amid
the deathlike stillness of a place so sad, so gloomy.
"The echoes seem to come from an amazing distance."
</p>

<p>
"Oui: I will vouch for it, Monsieur never saw a
place like this before.  The Parisian dead of a dozen
centuries are piled about us, and afford fine scope for
philosophy and moralising.  Diable! what an uproar
there will be among all these separated heads, legs,
and arms, when the last trumpet sounds; and many
a hearty malediction will be bestowed on Monsieur
Lenoir, of the Correctional Police, who, to please the
morbid taste of the good bourgeoisie of Paris, made
all this ghastly display.  Corboeuff! the skulls are all
piled up like cannon balls in the arsenal&mdash;there were
more than two millions of them at the last muster.
But, hark!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment we heard a distant cry of "A la
lanterne!  Death to the Englishman!" and a rush
of footsteps down the long staircase followed.
</p>

<p>
"We had better secure our retreat," said the French
captain; "all the avenues are closed, save that at the
Val de Grace; and if messieurs the gensd'armes
possess themselves of it, we shall be captured like mice
in a trap.  The lieutenant-general ordered all the
other outlets to be closed, because they afforded safe
and sudden retreats for chevaliers d'industrie, and
other worthies, who, after nightfall, become thick as
locusts in the streets of this pious and good city of
Paris.  Nombril de Belzebub! behold! our friends
have been reinforced."
</p>

<p>
I looked back, and could see a party of about
twenty gensd'armes advancing, but at a great distance,
and their fixed bayonets flashed like stars in these
misty caverns.  The mob were in hundreds behind
them, and the clatter of their feet and their cries rang
with a thousand reverberations through the vast
vacuity of these echoing catacombs.  We could see
them all distinctly; for though a quarter of a mile
distant, the lamps burned brightly where they were
passing.
</p>

<p>
"I have my sabre, and will confront these rascals,"
I exclaimed, becoming inflamed with sudden passion;
"they dare not lay hands on me, as a British officer."
</p>

<p>
"Peste!" he replied, laughing; "I think you have
seen whether they will or not.  'T is better not to trust
them; a bayonet stab I do not mind, but think how
unpleasant for a gentleman to be captured at the
instance of a few rascally citizens.  'T will never do!
We are not far now from the Val de Grace.  This
way, up the steps, and I will lead you to a secret
doorway, near a nice little house that I know of, and where
a pretty face will welcome us with smiles."
</p>

<p>
By the hand he conducted me up several flights of
steps, along an excavated corridor, where the cold
wind blew freely in my face, and from thence by a
doorway, the exact locality of which seemed well
known to him, ushered me into a dark and quiet
street, in a part of Paris quite unknown to me.
</p>

<p>
"My friend, we are safe; that is the Val de Grace,"
said my frank captain, pointing to a large mass of
building; "there is the Rue Marionette, and that
large street still full of open shops, light, and people,
is the Rue du Faubourg St. Jacques, which leads
straight across the river.  We can mingle with the
crowd, and there all traces of us will be lost."
</p>

<p>
"Any way you please," I replied; "never having
been in this part of Paris before, I am quite
bewildered.  Lead on, if you please; it is a dark place,
this."
</p>

<p>
"The Russians have probably been passing this
way.  It is well known in Paris that these piggish
Muscovites never return to their camp from a ball or
café without drinking up the contents of every lamp
within their reach; nor can all the alertness of the
gend'armerie prevent them."
</p>

<p>
On gaining the main street of the faubourg, the
blaze of the lighted shops, the long lines of lamps,
the gaiety and bustle which were seen on every side,
together with the free healthy breath of the upper air,
were a pleasant exchange for the dark and silent
caverns we had quitted, where breathing was almost
impossible, and the mind was oppressed by the gloom
of surrounding objects.
</p>

<p>
"Vive la joie!" exclaimed Captain St. Florian,
almost dancing as he took my arm; "how delightful is
the free air of the streets after leaving that pestilent
pit.  Ouf!  I shall never trust myself down there again.
But now we must sup together at a restaurateur's.
Come to the Oriflamme; 'tis down the Rue de
Bondy; Merci! there is a pretty waiteress there&mdash;a
perfect Hebe.  Her smart lace cap and braided apron&mdash;her
red cheeks and roguish eyes will quite vanquish
you."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, the Oriflamme be it."
</p>

<p>
"You will behold teeth and eyes that some of our
dames in the great world of fashion would give fifty
thousand francs to possess."
</p>

<p>
Turning down the street, we entered a restaurateur's,
on whose sign the Eagle of Napoleon had
lately given place to the ancient ensign of the Bourbons.
</p>

<p>
A very pretty girl who sat within the bar with a
handkerchief over her head, tied en marmotte, arose
and welcomed us with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, entrez Antoine St. Florian," said she, raising
her arched eyebrows with a true Parisian expression
of pleasure and familiarity; "entrez, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
St. Florian called her his 'belle Janette,' and
saluted her cheek with all the freedom of an old
friend, as she ushered us along a corridor, on each
side of which were neat little chambers, or cabinets,
each having a single table and two chairs.
</p>

<p>
That appropriated for us, had a lustre with two
lights, and the walls were decorated with coloured
prints of Jena, Marengo, Leipsic, and other
hard-fought battles, on which St. Florian soon began to
comment with all the ardour and enthusiasm of a
French soldier; and by his sentiments soon revealed,
that though poverty or policy had compelled him to
assume the scarlet trappings of King Louis' guards,
his heart was still with the fallen Emperor&mdash;the idol
of a hundred thousand soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"And so your old regiment was the 23rd?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the 23rd of the Emperor," he replied with a
sigh, while his eyes lighted up at the name.
</p>

<p>
"I remember that we charged your regiment at
the passage of the Nive, where I was on the very
point of sabreing a young officer, before I fortunately
perceived that the poor fellow's sword arm was tied
up in a sling, and that he was quite defenceless."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, how singular! and you saved him from
your troopers, and conducted him out of the press&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For which he gave me a draught of country wine
from his canteen."
</p>

<p>
"The same.  Ah, monsieur, my friend, I am that
officer, and I owe you eternal thanks."
</p>

<p>
We shook hands with ardour.
</p>

<p>
"I had been severely wounded by the poniard of a
villanous Spanish peasant, and was still suffering
from its effects.  Ah, it was quite a story, that affair;
my evil eye brought it all about."
</p>

<p>
"Your evil eye?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he replied, laughing; "you would not
think I had one, to look at me&mdash;I seem so innocent;
but so I have, or, at least, had when I was in Spain;
ha! ha! You have often heard the Spaniards speak
of the Evil Eye&mdash;the Malocchio of the Italians? and
how the women will veil themselves, cover up their
children, and mutter a prayer if a stranger but glances
at them."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard of that superstition, when on the
borders of Estremadura; but your affair&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, and fill your glass with the champagne&mdash;I
call it 'The Evil Eye.'&mdash;'T is a perfect romance,
and was well known to many a brave fellow of the
23rd, who has found his grave at the foot of Mont St. Jean."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
THE WIDOW; OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
"I was quartered with my company of grenadiers at
El Puerto, a wretched village in Andalusia; a poor
place it was, that had been rifled by our foragers a
dozen times, and we very unwisely made it still more
miserable, by burning the best cottages before we
were ordered to quit it.
</p>

<p>
"I quartered myself on the best casa in the village,
a red-tiled hut, that belonged to a strange-looking
fellow, whose long visage and long legs, great black
eyes, yellow trunk breeches, green doublet, and
sugar-loaf hat, made him seem half muleteer, half gitano.
I believe, from his superstitious observances, that he
was the latter wholly.  You will know, doubtless, how
famous Andalusia is for its women and horses.  Ha!
I wish you had seen the wife of my long-legged
patron.  She had the beautiful eyes and olive skin
of her native province, with teeth like pearls, lips
like cherries, and a face full of the sweetness of the
mildest Madonna.  Ha! ha!  I am growing quite
poetical! but wine or love always make me so.
You will never see, even on our Boulevards, and that
is a bold assertion, a pair of more superb ankles,
than the short red petticoats of that Andalusian
woman revealed to the pure gaze of your most
obedient servant.  Peste!  I was quite enchanted with
my pretty patrona, and determined on sending her
husband, tied across a mule, as a spy to the British
lines, that so I might be rid of him for a time, or for
ever.
</p>

<p>
"They had a child, too, a merry little brat, with
which I often played and toyed, to please its mother,
whose heart was quite won by the bonbons I gave it;
while her tall ghostly don of a husband stood sullenly
aloof, smoking a paper cigar, and regarding me from
beneath his broad sombrero, with eyes full of jealousy
and malice.  Now, as the devil would have it, the
little brat had long been ailing, and seemed very
likely to die at the time we came to El Puerto; and
as she watched her sleeping infant, the mother's eyes
were often suffused with tears.  This, you may be
aware, served but to make the charming Spaniard
more interesting; for her melting black orbs seemed
to be ever steeped in the most delicious languor.
</p>

<p>
"One evening I became very much aware of this;
and after toying a little with the sickly infant, by
tickling its neck with a braid of the mother's long
black hair, while I lisped soft nothings from time to
time, I departed to look for Jean Graule, my sergeant,
to hold a consultation about the safe transmission of
the señor patron to the British lines, and with my
compliments to the officer commanding the nearest
out-picquet.
</p>

<p>
"The evening was rather gloomy; I missed my
way, and strolled into one of those underground
vaults, bodegas, as they are called, where the peasants
keep their wine in Andalusia.  There I amused
myself probing the pigskins with my sword, and
imbibing the cool balmy wine from the orifice, till,
somehow, a heaviness stole over me, and I fell fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
"About midnight I awoke, and found myself alone
in the dark bodega, drenched with the wine that had
flowed from the wounded skins; and feeling very
cold, with the agreeable accompaniments of an
aching head and sore bones.
</p>

<p>
"By the moonlight which struggled through a
grated window, I sought my way out of the vault,
up the stair, and gained the street of the silent
Puebla, where I stood still for some time to rally my
scattered faculties, and recollect where I was.  While
this passed, a man, who had been concealed under
the shadow of a vine trellis, rushed upon me, and
furiously struck at my breast with a knife or dagger.
My shoulder-belt saved me from the stroke; 't was
lucky that I had it on, otherwise I should not have
been enjoying monsieur's society, and this glorious
wine, to-night.
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, mouchard, vagabond!' I exclaimed, and
closing in a desperate struggle with the would-be
assassin, succeeded in striking him to the earth;
where, holding my sword at his throat, I demanded
his reasons for assailing me thus.
</p>

<p>
"'To have slain you!' he growled.
</p>

<p>
"'For what, you base rascal?'
</p>

<p>
"'To have revenged the loss of my child,' replied
the fellow, whom I now recognised to be no other
than my worthy patron, the long-legged paisano.
</p>

<p>
"'Ouf!' said I.
</p>

<p>
"'Dog of a Frenchman! on the day you first came
into my poor cottage the child was well and strong,
for it was under the protection of the Blessed Virgin;
but you turned an evil eye upon it, and, lo! it
sickened; day by day it grew worse, and to-night it died:
not even romero at its neck, nor the agua bendita on
its brow, could shield it from your evil influence.  Son
of Satan, I spit upon you!'
</p>

<p>
"'A pest upon your brat, you insolent madman,'
said I, almost laughing, for the wine of the bodega
had still its influence over me: 'had you said that I
cast evil eyes on your wife, there might have been
some truth in the matter; but your child&mdash;ha, ha!'
and I laughed till the street of the Puebla rang again.
'Halloo, Sergeant Graule&mdash;quarter guard&mdash;ho, there!'
and a dozen of my grenadiers rushed from a tavern
to my assistance.
</p>

<p>
"To Jean Graule's care I recommended the señor,
and in five minutes, at the end of a tent cord, he
swung from the chimney of a neighbouring house.
</p>

<p>
"'Now, señor rascal,' said I, making him a mock
bow, on leaving him in the grasp of the soldiers, 'I
will go and console your pretty wife for the loss of
her child, and more particularly that of her amiable
spouse.  Both are so easily replaced, that I would
recommend you to die in peace, my jovial pagan.'
</p>

<p>
"'My wife, my wife!' said he, in a terrible voice,
striking his breast and looking upwards.  'El Santo
de los Santos&mdash;Holy of Holies, forgive me.'
</p>

<p>
"'Console yourself, my friend,' said I, while Jean
Graule and the soldiers laughed till their belts nearly
burst.  'Console yourself, señor paisano, for your
little wife shall laugh and be merry to-night.'
</p>

<p>
"'She waits you,' said he, with a frightful smile.
Diable! methinks I can see his white face, as he
grinned, like a shark, in the moonlight; 'She awaits
you.'
</p>

<p>
"Graule dragged him off.
</p>

<p>
"I hurried to the cottage of the paisano; but,
mon Dieu, what a sight awaited me!
</p>

<p>
"On her bed, a miserable mat, lay the beautiful
Andalusian girl, stone dead; stabbed by a poniard
thrice in the neck, and her little infant, also dead, lay
in her arms, pressed to her crimson bosom.  In the
first gust of my fury I rushed out to slay the jealous
perpetrator of this horror; but he had, as I have
already said, paid the debt of nature, and his dying
form was wavering in the moonlight from the
gable-end of a neighbouring house.
</p>

<p>
"Bah! there is always something in this reminiscence
that makes me dismal&mdash;but let me think no
more of it."
</p>

<p>
And draining his glass of champagne, the gay
St. Florian began to hum an old camp song, beating time
with his fingers on the well-polished table.  Though
this episode of his life rather decreased my admiration
for this gay fellow, still the jaunty manner in
which he related it somewhat amused me.
</p>

<p>
With the pretty Janette he appeared to be an
old-established friend; and a great deal of flirting, and
that kind of conversation which consists of pretty
trifles, ensued each time she appeared on the ringing
of the bell.  But the ci-devant grenadier of Napoleon
was doubtless on the same easy footing with all the
waiteresses and shop-girls in every warehouse, cabaret,
and café in and about Paris.
</p>

<p>
As the night was rather chilly, I proposed that we
should have some mulled port, spiced with cloves and
sugar, in a mode I had often had it prepared at Madrid
by an old patrona on whom I was billeted.
</p>

<p>
St. Florian's countenance changed at the mention
of the mulled wine, and with ill-concealed disgust
and precipitation he protested against it, swearing by
the head of the Pope, that although he never drank
water when anything better could be had, he would
rather drink it out of a ditch, after a brigade of horse
had passed through it, than taste mulled wine of any
kind.
</p>

<p>
"And why so?" I asked, astonished by his vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"Sacre nom&mdash;'tis another long story; but Chataigneur,
of the 23rd, and I, were as nearly brought
to the threshold of death as may be by some muddy
liquor called mulled port, and I never could look
upon it, or think of it, with any degree of patience.
You will find the story in all the French and Spanish
newspapers.  Ouf! it made a devil of a noise in the
army."
</p>

<p>
"I should be glad to hear it," said I, touching the
bell-rope; "but in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We will have some more champagne.  Yes, the
champagne of the Oriflamme is delicious.  I have
drunk a tun here, I believe&mdash;aye, in this very room,
with Jacques Chataigneur.  There are some
caricatures of Monsieur Vellainton which he chalked on
the wall.  Poor Jacques! a shot from that cursed
Chateau of Hougomont passed through his heart,
when, sword in hand, he was leading on the
grenadiers of the great Emperor to conquest or to death.
He fell within a yard of me, prone over his horse's
crupper, and his last words were&mdash;'To the charge, to
the charge!  Vive l'Empereur!'  If true courage and
bravery are rewarded in heaven&mdash;but, ma foi!  I am
growing quite pathetic.  Where is the wine?  Janette,"
he cried, down the passage, "Janette, my princess!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah oui, monsieur&mdash;me voila!" replied the girl,
running in.
</p>

<p>
"My dear girl, let us have some champagne, a few
more cigars, and a nice little tray of grapes, or
bon-bons; but let the wine be bright as your own eyes,
my wanton."
</p>

<p>
The girl was tripping away.
</p>

<p>
"But halt, Janette," he added, catching her by the
skirt; "how long is it since a rough moustache has
been pressed to that pretty cheek of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur St. Florian, you are pleased to be very
rude."
</p>

<p>
"Come, coquette, do not affect to mistake pure
admiration for rudeness.  Now you owe one salute,
my pretty Janette, for remember how you fled from
me last night on the Quai de la Conference."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, one only," said she, tendering her
cheek, which was slightly rouged.
</p>

<p>
St. Florian stole three.
</p>

<p>
"Ah treacherous!" exclaimed the girl, striking him
playfully with her hand, and skipping away.
</p>

<p>
"Peste!" said the captain, twirling his moustache;
"but your little fingers smart, my pretty one."
</p>

<p>
"Now for the other story, Monsieur St. Florian,"
said I, when the bright wine sparkled in the tall
glasses, and our fair attendant had withdrawn.  "I
would fain learn why an old soldier dislikes any sort
of wine.  I have often drank ditch-water on the line
of march, and have gladly filled my canteen from the
ruts of the artillery wheels&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And so have I a thousand times, but my dislike
to mulled port arises from something more than mere
prejudice&mdash;bah! this is worth an ocean of a muddy
drench, boiled in a kettle with sugar and cloves.  See
how it sparkles when the glass is raised to the light.
Ma foi! 't is like a glass full of diamonds.  We shall
drink to the emperor."
</p>

<p>
"I have no objection."
</p>

<p>
"I hope the door is closed, though.  Paris is such
a city for espionage, police, and informers: Ouf! but
'Vive l'Empereur Napoleon!'" and he drained his
long glass, while his dark eyes flashed with
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Long life to him!" said I, with a frankness that
won the Frenchman's heart; "and now let me know
the cause of this horror of mulled wine."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you have already heard it.  I well
remember that it made a deuced noise at the time it
occurred, and, save the maid of Zaragossa, there
never was a woman so extolled by the Spaniards as
she of whom I am about to speak,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "THE WIDOW OF MADRID;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
for so he named the following story.
</p>

<p>
"It was in the month of December, when the
immortal emperor and the victorious army of France
captured Madrid, that Jacques Chataigneur, four officers
of the Imperial Guard, and myself, were quartered,
or rather, according to the unceremonious custom of
war in the like cases, took the liberty of quartering
ourselves, on a house in one of the most fashionable
streets in the city.
</p>

<p>
"Every place within the walls was full of our
troops; horse and foot were swarming in tens of
thousands; the red rosette and the banner of Castile
and Leon had disappeared; the French eagle soared
in triumph over the capital of the Spaniards.  Every
house, from the great palace of the Duke d'Ossuna
to the poorest casa on the margin of the Manzanares,
was undergoing a strict investigation, to discover
where Messieurs the Spaniards had hid their doubloons
and other valuables, for which the pouches and
haversacks of our soldiers were yawning.
</p>

<p>
"Our fellows were rather riotous, especially about
the cafés and wine-houses, where every man drank
his fill, without being at the expense of a single sou.
The city was involved in chaos and uproar.  Merci! 't
was such a hubbub as you in all your service can
never have witnessed; for, what with disarming the
men, and running after pretty women, searching for
wine, provisions, and plunder, our soldiers had quite
enough of business on their hands.
</p>

<p>
"The house which we honoured with our presence,
on this auspicious occasion, was a handsome mansion,
with broad balconies, and lofty saloons, having gilded
ceilings, tiled floors, and rich furniture; and you may
imagine how acceptable the splendid bed-chambers
were to us, who had been under canvas for months.
</p>

<p>
"It belonged to Donna Elvira de Almeria, whose
family had just been reduced to one daughter, by the
unexpected deaths of her husband and three sons,
who had fallen on the previous day sword in hand, as
she told us, like true cavaliers, defending the palace
of the Betiro, which had been breached by the cannon
of the Marshal Duke of Belluno; but the ghastly
gap had been defended with admirable resolution and
bravery by the Spaniards; so the soldiers of the
emperor, petulant at all times, were somewhat
exasperated in consequence.
</p>

<p>
"We, ourselves, were ripe for mischief, and I cannot
rehearse all the fine things we did in our ramble
through the city that night: I beseech you to suppose them.
</p>

<p>
"The household of the Donna Elvira were, as
may be imagined, overwhelmed with terror and grief
by the misfortune which war had brought upon them;
and their condition was in no way soothed or
ameliorated by our appearance among them, blackened with
powder and smoke, and bespattered with blood and
dust, for we had hewn our way in by the breach at
the Retiro.
</p>

<p>
"The ladies were both handsome, but more especially
the daughter Virginia, a timid girl of about
fifteen; and at these years a Spaniard is almost a
woman.  Her tears, I blush to say, made little
impression on me, but her beauty had a great effect on
as all.  However, drunk as we were, we remembered
Chataigneur was our senior officer, and that his
pleasure must be known before the officer next in
rank presumed to open the trenches; or, in other
words, address the ladies in the language of gallantry.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques was a child of the revolution, an
iron-hearted soldier, penetrable only to steel and
lead&mdash;half fox, half wolf; to anything soft or sentimental,
he was immovable as a cannon-ball.  It was said in
the 23rd, that he had done some terrible things in La
Vendée, and certainly his more recent campaigns in
Holland and Italy had taught him to view with the
coolness of a stoic the blood of the bravest men and
the tears of the most beautiful women.
</p>

<p>
"Peste! he was a true philosopher, and one might
march from Dunkirk to Damascus without meeting
such another.  He was never troubled with any
unpleasant qualms of conscience&mdash;not he, because, like
most of those fierce soldiers, who had been trained
and nurtured amid the horrors of the revolution, he
believed in neither God nor devil, heaven nor hell,
and, consequently, cared not a straw for any of
them."
</p>

<p>
"A pretty picture of your friend and comrade,"
said I, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Peste! yes.  He should have appointed me to
write his epitaph.  Chataigneur was the man it was
a pleasure to follow to the breach or battle-field; for
he cared as little for riding headlong on the charged
bayonets of a solid square, or manoeuvring his
regiment under a storm of grape-shot, as for handing his
partner through the figures of a quadrille.  But, to
return.  The ladies, on perceiving us enter their
mansion uninvited, gave us a specimen of Spanish
hauteur, by retiring to a distant apartment, and
leaving us to provide for ourselves.
</p>

<p>
"This we were not long in doing.  The servants
had fled; but Chataigneur ordered three grenadiers
of the 23rd, who were in attendance upon us, to break
down the doors of the cellars and other repositories:
thus, in the twinkling of an eye, we had the sherry,
the Malaga, and the Ciudad Real of the old beldame
in abundance.
</p>

<p>
"We installed ourselves in the finest saloon of the
mansion, while messieurs our servants possessed
themselves of the kitchen, where they stripped off
their accoutrements and coats, piled half-a-dozen
shutters, a door, and a chair or two on the hearth;
and so zealous were they in preparing a repast for us,
that the rascals nearly set the house on fire.  All the
pantries were laid under contribution, and large
conscriptions were levied on the poultry-yard, and we
were soon as merry as magnificent quarters, a
plenteous supper, and wine ad libitum, without having a
sou to pay for them all, could make us.  We drank
deadly bumpers in honour of the emperor, to the
success of his armies, to ourselves, to the continuation of
the war, to the girls we had left behind us in
beautiful France, and the devil alone knows what more.
Oh, the exquisite delights of living at free quarters in
an enemy's country!  Vive la joie!  I need not
expatiate upon them to you, for I heard of your pretty
doings after Badajoz fell."
</p>

<p>
"They could not compare with yours at Madrid."
</p>

<p>
"You shall hear.  'In the ardour of our attack
upon the savoury viands,' said the Chevalier de
Vivancourt, a gay sub-lieutenant of the guard, 'we are
quite forgetting the ladies!'
</p>

<p>
"'Mon Dieu! yes&mdash;what negligence!' said one
or two ironically.
</p>

<p>
"'I shall make amends for our ungallantry,' said
Chataigneur, starting up and staggering unsteadily;
for he had enough of Ciudad Real under his belt to
have served even a German.  'Hola!  Pierre, Jean
Graule, where are the ladies, just now&mdash;eh? the
sour-visaged madame and plump little mademoiselle?'
</p>

<p>
"'Shall I have the honour of conducting them to
the presence of monsieur?' said our sergeant, giving
his military salute.  'The mother&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh the devil take the mother, or you may have
her yourself, honest Jean.'
</p>

<p>
"The sergeant bowed, and grinned.
</p>

<p>
"'But sabre de bois! 't is the little daughter I
want,' said Chataigneur.
</p>

<p>
"'They are at prayer in their little oratory, I
believe,' urged the chevalier, who was the least wicked
among us.
</p>

<p>
"'Praying!' reiterated Jacques with intense
disgust; 'I shall soon change their cheer.  Are there
any guitars or mandolins here?  The girl&mdash;what's
her name?  Virginia shall bear us company in a
merry chorus, or shall ride the cheval de bois with a
vengeance.'
</p>

<p>
"'Let us have her by all means,' said one of the
Imperial guardsmen; 'we must teach this young
creature the first rudiments of love and coquetry.'
</p>

<p>
"'Will some of you lend a hand to undo the clasp
of this infernal sword-belt?' grumbled Jacques, who
was very tipsy.  'Avaunt, Jean Graule, thou art
drunk, man!  Vivancourt, most redoubtable chevalier
of the immortal legion of honour, lend me thine aid.
Corboeuf!  I am swollen like a huge tortoise with
Ciudal Real.  Now, messieurs, remember that I am
the senior officer here, and that whoever follows me
does so at his peril.'
</p>

<p>
"And half-dancing, half staggering, he swaggered
out of the room accompanied by Jean Graule.
</p>

<p>
"We continued to enjoy ourselves with supreme
nonchalance, for the Imperial Guard and the 23rd
Grenadiers were the most reckless routiers in the
army.  Believe me, we were too much accustomed to
storming to trouble ourselves much about the little
Spanish girl; but I am forgetting that you are not a
Frenchman; so, fearing to shock your cold British
prejudices, I will, as the novelists say, draw a veil
over what passed;" and M. de St. Florian smiled
complacently as he emptied and refilled his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible!" I exclaimed, with something of
incredulity in my manner; "is it possible that brave
soldiers, and gentlemen of France&mdash;France, once so
famous for its spirit of honour and chivalry&mdash;could
behave thus?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, my word is never doubted," replied
the other good-humouredly; "how could you expect
us to behave like saints or apostles, or perhaps
like the cool stoics that compose a regiment of
kilts?
</p>

<p>
"Chataigneur was absent with Jean Graule about
an hour, during which time we scarcely missed him,
so closely did we pay court to the glittering decanters
and bloated pig-skins, which we laid under contribution
without mercy.  The wax lights, were becoming
double; the saloon was beginning to swim around us;
and we were in the very midst of singing the carmagnole
in full chorus, at the utmost pitch of our lungs,
each having his drawn sabre in his right hand, and a
mantling cup in his left, when the door was dashed
open and Jacques Chataigneur entered, with Donna
Elvira supported on one arm, and her daughter
Donna Virginia on the other.
</p>

<p>
"With a triumphant and scornful air, he led or
rather half dragged them in, and forced them to sit
down at table with us.
</p>

<p>
"Although being so tipsy that I could scarcely
know whether my head or heels were uppermost, I
can still remember the terrible expression depicted in
the faces of these two ladies.  The mother's wore the
fury and rage of a tigress; the blood seemed to boil
in the swollen veins of her temples, and her large
black Spanish eyes shot fire from time to time as she
surveyed us.  Her daughter's appeared the very
reverse, and her face expressed only the darkness of
despair.
</p>

<p>
"She was very beautiful; her long black hair was
loosened from its braids, and hung matted in
disorder about her shoulders, and half concealed her
face, which was pale as death.  Her eyes&mdash;you will
remember the splendid eyes of the Spanish girls&mdash;her
eyes were bloodshot and red with weeping; their
expression was wild, wandering, insane; and there
was a chilling air of desolation and abandonment in
her grief that had, indeed, a very considerable effect
on me (for I am not altogether such a bad fellow as
monsieur may suppose me), although her utter despair
had none on Chataigneur and my more intoxicated
companions.
</p>

<p>
"Her lips were quivering, and her graceful Spanish
dress, her long veil particularly, was torn to ribands.
</p>

<p>
"'Messieurs,' said Chataigneur, bowing with an
air of mock politeness; 'I am permitted to have the
high honour of introducing you to the notice of
Donna Elvira de Almeria, widow of a very brave
Caballero y Procuradore of new Castile, and her
daughter the enchanting Virginia, whom, as I have
two ladies who equally claim the title of Madame la
Colonel, I shall advance to the ancient Spanish
dignity of being my Barragano,* which will square all
matters between us, so Vive la joie! let us drink and
be merry!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The eyes of the Spaniards absolutely glared as
he spoke."
</p>

<p>
"The scoundrel!" I exclaimed, becoming excited
by this revolting narrative.  "Would to heaven that
I had been there with a few of my English hussars."
</p>

<p>
"That would have availed little," replied St. Florian,
pouring out his wine with slow sang froid;
"every street and house within the trenches was
swarming with our soldiers; and such scenes as that
I have described were innumerable."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Monsieur le Capitaine; but I must
pronounce your comrade to have been a finished
rascal."
</p>

<p>
"Peste!" muttered the Frenchman, half angrily;
and then he continued, while laughing and twirling
his moustache, "Opinion is the queen of the world&mdash;'t
is a proverb we have, and a true one.  But poor
Chataigneur is gone now, and I must not hear him
abused.
</p>

<p>
"But, to continue.  The excitement of the
preceding day's fighting, and the quantity of wine we
had drunk, rendered us insensible to the distresses of
these poor women; and with shame and sorrow I
now remember that we permitted Chataigneur, by
dint of many a savage threat, to compel them to
assume their guitars and sing in accompaniment,
while we chaunted a bacchanalian ditty suited only
for the meridian of the lowest cabaret in the faubourg
St. Antoine.
</p>

<p>
"What they sang Heaven only knows, for, nom
d'un Pape! my comrade, the horrible catastrophe to
this little supper has fairly driven all minor incidents
from my memory.  And there they sat and sang to
us&mdash;sang with shame on their brows, and rage, and
grief, and agony in their hearts&mdash;while a husband
and three sons, a father and three brothers, were
lying dead in their harness by the walls of the Retiro.
</p>

<p>
"We drank bumpers to Virginia, and made the
ceiling shake with our mad laughter and revelry.  In
the midst of this, unluckily, the Chevalier de
Vivancourt called for a bumper of mulled port.  What
fiend prompted a request so useless I cannot imagine:
but we all joined in his demand vociferously; and the
old dame, who appeared to have somewhat recovered
her equanimity, desired her daughter to prepare it.
She spoke in Basque Spanish, which we did not
understand, but which should have been sufficient to
kindle our suspicions; and I could perceive that a
wild and almost insane expression flashed in the eyes
of the little Donna Virginia as she flung aside her
guitar and rose to execute the order.
</p>

<p>
"With some trouble she extricated herself from
Chataigneur, whose arm was round her waist.  He
was very angry, and growled like a bear at the
chevalier, swearing by the sabre de bois that he would
put him under arrest for the trouble he occasioned.
</p>

<p>
"While he was yet speaking, Virginia returned
with the prepared wine in a crystal vase, from which,
with her own fair hands, she filled our long, carved
glasses.  We drank to her, draining them to the
dregs; and, with a grim smile on her pallid lips, our
youthful cupbearer replenished our glasses.  The
flavour of the wine was so exquisite, that Chataigneur
embraced Virginia with drunken ardour, and desired
her to bring us more.
</p>

<p>
"'You will require no more!' she cried, with a
shriek, as she flung the vase from her hands, and it
was dashed into a hundred pieces.
</p>

<p>
"We rose in alarm, but instantly sank again on
our seats; and at that moment a peculiar and horrible
sensation came over me.  Sacre! methinks I feel it
yet.  I looked upon my companions of the carousal,
but read in their faces an expression that yielded me
anything but comfort.  Three had dropped their
glasses, and reclined upon their chairs, with open
mouths and fixed eyes, which gleamed with the vacant
wildness of insanity.  The Chevalier de Vivancourt
sank prostrate on the floor, while Chataigneur, who
seemed also about to sink, turned and stared with a
powerless aspect of rage and alarm at Donna Elvira.
</p>

<p>
"Virginia had sunk upon her knees and hid her
face in the skirt of her torn dress; but her mother
stood erect, and, with her arms outstretched towards
us, shrieked in a frightful voice between a moan and
a yell, while a murderous rage, alike fiendish and
terrible, caused her tall form to tremble, her proud
nostrils to dilate, and her large dark eyes to gleam
like those of a rattlesnake.
</p>

<p>
"'At last we have avenged ourselves!  Perros y
ladrones!  Frenchmen, dogs, and murderers, let me
scream into your dying ears, that we are Castilian
women, and have avenged our wrongs!  I have lost
my brave husband and his noble sons&mdash;by numbers
you destroyed them, and side by side they fell on the
palace threshold of the kings of Castile.  Oh,
bloodhounds&mdash;worse than devils in the form of men, ye
murdered them, and now&mdash;my daughter (her voice
became choked), my innocent little daughter&mdash;but we
are revenged&mdash;revenged&mdash;revenged!  Oh, Santa
Maria, Virgin, y Madre de Jesu! let us be forgiven&mdash;but,
fiends, the sure, cold hands of death are upon
you&mdash;you are dying, for the wine you have drunk is
poisoned!'
</p>

<p>
"Mon Dieu!" said St. Florian, pausing while the
perspiration almost suffused his forehead, "still the
screech-owl voice of that detestable hag seems to ring
in my tingling ears!
</p>

<p>
"Inspired by terror and rage, I made an effort to
spring up, to draw my sabre, to run her through the
heart; but the moment my hand touched the hilt, a
deadly numbness crept over me; I staggered
backward, and while sleep and despair came over my
soul, sank prone and insensible on the corpses of my
comrades!"
</p>

<p>
St. Florian paused again for an instant, for he
really seemed considerably excited by the
recollection of the adventure.
</p>

<p>
"Parbleu! 'twas a most unpleasant denouement&mdash;a
devil of a winding-up.  Next morning I found my
self lying prostrate on the chilly floor of the Church
of the Conception, which, with many others, had
been converted into a temporary hospital for the sick
and wounded.  I was sick for seventeen days, and
my head ached as if it had been crushed in a vice;
while my miserable throat was skinned by the stomach
pump and other engines of the medical science, which
the staff surgeon had kept at work on me, as they
afterwards said, for two consecutive hours.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Jacques Chataigneur was in the same
wretched condition, and lay opposite to me, kennelled
on a bed of straw, under the gothic canopy which
covered the grave perhaps of some long-bearded
hidalgo of old Castile.
</p>

<p>
"We alone recovered.
</p>

<p>
"The gay Chevalier de Vivancourt and his three
comrades of la Garde Imperiale died; so did poor
Jean Graule and all our servants; for the little fury
Virginia had administered part of her infernal potion
to them too.  So to this hour, my friend, I entertain
such a horror of all kinds of prepared wine, that I
may safely say, 'tis not in the power of man, or even
woman, with all her superlative cunning and witchery,
to make me taste a single drop that is not pure as
when it came from the wine-press."
</p>

<p>
"And the ladies&mdash;what became of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Donna Elvira," continued my garrulous friend,
"disappeared from Madrid on that very night, taking
with her the unlucky Virginia, and for a time we
heard no more of them, save in the columns of the
'Moniteur' and 'El Espanol,' where, the Lord knows,
our malheur made more than noise enough!  May
mischief dog their heels as two revengeful vixens.
But I afterwards learned that the girl assumed another
name, and, bestowing her hand on a certain hidalgo
of Alava, actually had the happiness to give me shelter
one night on the retreat from Vittoria.  My whiskers
had grown, and she did not recognise me; sacre bleu,
if she had!  I was never discovered, and blessed
my stars that I was sound, wind and limb, when I
left her mansion in the morning&mdash;Ouf! let me think
no more of it, for altogether 't is a story that makes
me shudder."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Captain St. Florian," said I, when he
had ceased; "but on my honour, you make me blush
for the army of France."
</p>

<p>
"Morbleu!" said he; "they were only Spaniards."
</p>

<p>
"But I have heard many an episode of horror
blacker even than that of Donna Elvira, for I was
one of those who followed up the retreating army of
Massena, from the frontiers of Portuguese Estremadura,
through desert fields and desolate cities,
marked by fire and blood, and all that the wantonness
and wickedness your devastators could inflict
on a poor, a prostrate, and a defenceless people.  I
am warm, monsieur, but I pray you pardon me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! he was a stern old routier, Massena, and
handled the dons so roughly, that the Emperor named
him rightly the 'child of rapine.'  I care not for being
his apologist, as I never either loved or admired him,
and once positively hated the old pagan, for
reprimanding me in general orders, because, on our
retreat from the lines of Torres Vedras, I neglected to
destroy the house of a poor old hidalgo near
Santarem, who had been so kind to me, that I omitted
him in the list of devastations to be made by my
foragers.  Ouf!  I got a lecture that was printed in
the 'Moniteur,' and read at the head of every
regiment in the division.  But in revenge, that very
night I affixed a scroll to the door of the marshal's
quarters, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'This is the residence of the mighty Massena,
Prince of Essling and Duke of Rivoli, who has made
more noise in the world by beating the drum than
by beating the British!'
</p>

<p>
"Corboeuf! what a frightful rage the old Turk was
in, but he could never discover the author of the
pasquil, which made him the laughing-stock of the
whole army.  But the sparing of that hidalgo's
mansion and family was a most fortunate circumstance
for me, as it was the means of saving my life three
days after."
</p>

<p>
"In what manner?"
</p>

<p>
"He ransomed me for a hundred dollars from
some rascally frontier guerillas who had captured
me, and were on the point of putting me to death.
Ouf! 'twas a devil of an adventure that.  Shall I tell
it you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please," said I, lighting a fourth cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, listen, though perhaps it is not so
much my story as that of a poor peasant whom the
Estremadurans named Perez the Potter."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
PEREZ, THE POTTER; OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
"When Massena retired before the impetuous
advance of Lord Wellington, and left behind the
boasted lines of Torres Vedras, you may remember
that he selected the position of Santarem as one
admirably adapted to keep in check the advance of
your troops through the Portuguese frontier.  While
his division occupied their trenches on the hill above
the Tagus, I was one day despatched on duty to the
officer commanding the Cuirassier Brigade at Torres
Novas, a town five leagues from Santarem, situated in
the middle of a beautiful plain.  It is surrounded by
walls, and is overlooked by the castle with the nine
towers, from which it takes its name.
</p>

<p>
"I rode without an orderly, or other followers, for
the whole country was covered with our troops, and I
had no dread of molestation, though desired by
Marshal Massena to take with me a section of
dragoons, as part of the country through which I had to
pass was rendered very unsafe by the residence and
outrages of a certain Don Julian d'Aviero, a half-mad
student of Alcala, who had gathered a band of
deserter guerillas, and become a captain of robbers
in the woods of Santarem.  There his name had
become terrible through all the Spanish and
Portuguese Estremaduras, Alentejo and Beira.  His
midnight expeditions and attacks upon the detached
houses and solitary quintas of friend and foe were
characterised by singular and wanton cruelty; and in
a state of warfare, where the country was possessed
by two hostile armies, the pretexts of treason and
espionage were never wanting.
</p>

<p>
"A wild yell informed the inmates that their
dwelling was surrounded by the banditti of Don
Julian; the doors were dashed in; the men, half-starting
from their beds, were hewn to pieces; their
wives and daughters were dragged away to suffer
worse than death; the houses were pillaged, and
then reduced to ashes.  And many of these atrocities
were doubtless attributed by us to you, and by you to
us.  Captives were carried off daily, but they were
generally ransomed; if not, a shot from a carbine,
or a stab from a poniard, and all was over!
</p>

<p>
"I thought of all these things as I pursued my
solitary way by the foot of the mountains that skirt
the plain of Torres Novas; but it was with less of
alarm than pleasure.  To me there seemed something
charming in the lonely and knight-errant-like
fashion in which I had thus ridden forth, in a strange
country, among dangerous ways, and an unscrupulous
people, with neither friend nor ally save my sabre
and horse.
</p>

<p>
"The sun was verging towards the darkening
mountains of Alentejo; but the atmosphere was still
exceedingly close and sultry, for, hot and bright, the
rays of the western sun were poured from a clear
and cloudless sky, scorching with their warmth the
waving corn, and the myriads of wild flowers that
covered the beautiful plain of Torres Novas.
</p>

<p>
"I was still far from the lines of Massena: the
country seemed desolate and depopulated.  I had no
guide, and became apprehensive of losing my way,
and wandering towards the British outposts.  Once
or twice I questioned a passing peasant, but was
provoked by their sullenness and ignorance of their
own locality.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor,' said I, to a paisano, whom I met driving
two mules harnessed in a rude cart, which was simply
composed of the rough stem of a tree, from which
two branches in the form of a fork rested, one on
each wheel, and formed the axle&mdash;'Señor, how many
leagues is it from this place to Santarem?'
</p>

<p>
"'Three, señor Caballero,' replied the man,
holding up three fingers.
</p>

<p>
"'Bueno! are they long or short?'
</p>

<p>
"'Short, señor.'
</p>

<p>
"There is, I know not why, a difference in the
length of the Spanish leagues, as many a time and
oft we found on the long line of march.  After riding
four or five miles further, and, being still uncertain,
on meeting another peasant driving a borrico (an ass),
laden with kid-skins of the mountain-wine, I inquired
of him the distance from Santarem on the Tagus.
</p>

<p>
"'Five long leagues, señor,' he replied, displaying
four fingers and a thumb.
</p>

<p>
"'Diable!' I muttered, and spurred on, for the
sun had now sunk behind the blue waving line of the
western Sierra.
</p>

<p>
"Near a roadside fountain I passed the bodies of
three or four French soldiers, who had been wounded
in a recent encounter with the outlaws of Julian
Aviero, and had crawled there to quench their thirst
and die.  They had been completely stripped by the
Spaniards, and their gory but honourable scars were
blackening in the heat of the sultry day.
</p>

<p>
"On the velvet turf that bordered the road I softly
drew up my horse, on observing behind the pedestal
of the fountain a villanous son of Israel practising
dental surgery, by robbing the jaws of the dead; for
the soldiers being generally young men, their teeth
brought a good price in the dentist shops of Paris
and Madrid.  I had frequently heard of this revolting
practice, but never till that moment had ocular proof
that such existed.
</p>

<p>
"The operator was a man about forty, lean and
hollow-visaged, with the brow of a villain, the eyes of
a snake, the nose of an eagle, and beard like a
cossacque; he was enveloped in a loose blue gown, and
his head was surmounted by a steeple-crowned
sombrero, that had long lost every trace of its original
colour.  Near him lay a square mahogany box, like a
pedlar's wallet, in which he carried his instruments
and stock of dental wares.
</p>

<p>
"He was so busy with the relaxed jaws of a
young soldier that he did not perceive my approach.
</p>

<p>
"You know how jealous we soldiers are of the
treatment given to the remains of our dead comrades.
Maladetto! my blood boiled.  Dashing spurs
into my horse, I plunged him right upon the dog of
an Israelite; a kick from a hoof laid bare his skull,
and stretched him prostrate on the earth.  As he fell
backwards I obtained a glimpse of his wallet, which
bristled with poniards and pistols, from which I
concluded him to be a robber of the living as well as of
the dead; and I soon discovered my conclusions to
be just.
</p>

<p>
"This rencontre occurred near a great olive wood,
which was known to be the haunt of Aviero; and I
rode as fast as possible to leave it behind before
nightfall; but I had not gone half-a-mile from the
fountain, when a sharp rifle shot whistled from a
grove of olives on my right.  My horse gave a snort
of agony, and fell heavily forward, stone dead.  A
bullet had pierced his brain.  I disengaged myself
from the stirrups, and drew my sabre, but ere I
could strike one blow in my defence, a hundred
hands were upon me, and I was a prisoner, in the
power of a band of savage frontier guerillas&mdash;half
soldiers, half robbers, and wholly demons.  Diable! my
life hung by a hair.
</p>

<p>
"Some wore broad hats, embroidered jackets, and
yellow scarfs, with plush breeches; others had little
other garment than their olive skins, and wore their
flowing hair of the deepest black, gathered in netted
cauls; but all were armed with rifles, daggers, and
pistols, or with all manner of military weapons
gathered from the fields of those battles which were
every day fought in their vicinity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Monsieur! what a moment of misery was
that when I found myself so completely at the mercy
of those ruffian Spaniards, whom I equally despised
and abhorred.
</p>

<p>
"Many a knife was drawn and many a blow
struck at me; but in their very fury and anxiety
to destroy me these wretches retarded, impeded, and
wounded each other.
</p>

<p>
"'Down with him! down with the Frenchman!
Death to the Buonapartist!  Maladetto!' was the
cry on every side.
</p>

<p>
"'Caramba!' cried one in a voice of thunder,
'I will blow out the brains of the first that injures
him.  Frenchman and dog as he is, our laws must
be respected.  Away with him to the mountains, for
Don Julian d'Aviero must decide his fate.'
</p>

<p>
"Aviero! my heart sunk; I was then quite in the
power of the devil.
</p>

<p>
"Amid a storm of growling and swearing, and
even fisticuffs, I was conducted through the wood,
which was almost pathless and covered the face of
the Sierra by which we ascended, to an old and ruined
villa, belonging to the Duke of Aviero.  It stood on
the edge of a precipice that overhung the Tagus, and
there Don Julian had for the present established his
head-quarters.  A recent attempt had been made, by
a detachment of ours, under Jacques Chataigneur, to
dislodge him; these had been repulsed with great
slaughter; and on approaching the villa, I could
discern vivid traces of the conflict&mdash;traces which its
amiable and philosophical inmates cared not to
trouble themselves as yet in removing.
</p>

<p>
"This noble residence of Don Julian's ancestors,
with its marble vestibule and stately portico, its
frescoed chambers and arcades of columns, round which
the vine and the rose were clambering, had been
no way improved by his occupation thereof.  A
balustraded terrace encircled it, and within and around it
the dead French and guerillas were lying across each
other in scores&mdash;many of them yet grasping their
adversaries, just as they had fallen, without their
hold relaxing, or the fierce expression which
distorted their features at the hour of death passing
away.
</p>

<p>
"Many of these men were my comrades, grenadiers
of the 23rd, whom I could recognise, notwithstanding
the alteration of their features.
</p>

<p>
"In the assault and defence, the doors and windows
of this beautiful villa had all been blown to
pieces; the walls were studded with bullets and
spattered with blood, which appeared to have run
like a rivulet down the staircase, to mingle with the
waters of a shattered jet d'eau in the vestibule.  At
the head of the stair a barricade had been formed by
a sideboard, a piano, and other furniture, wedged with
bolsters and pillows, and books; and this point of
assault had been fought for, like any breach in the glacis
of Badajoz.  Everywhere the bills and axes of the
pioneers had been at work; but Chataigneur had
been repulsed, and Don Julian remained impregnable
and triumphant.
</p>

<p>
"In a noble apartment, the windows of which
overlooked the Tagus and the vast plain that spread
in its beauty towards the castle and city of Torres
Novas, the ramparts of which were tipped with the
last gleam of the set sun, Don Julian, with several
of his desperadoes, sat over their cups of country
wine, muffled in their mantles, and enjoying paper
cigars, while their feet rested on a great copper
brassero of charcoal that stood in the centre of the
marble floor.
</p>

<p>
"Don Julian, a remarkably handsome young man,
but with a bold, reckless, and ferocious cast of
features, received me with a low bow, which I could
perceive to be partly ironical.  His jacket of green
velvet was richly brocaded and fastened with silver
clasps; his breast was displayed by an open shirt,
and had a crucifix engraven on it by gunpowder.  He
wore yellow breeches girt by a sash, red stockings
and abarcas; but had no weapons save his sabre.
</p>

<p>
"When he addressed me, I expected to hear but
my death warrant; judge how agreeably I was
surprised by his saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Señor, though you are a Frenchman, and I
might this moment put you to death as an invader
of Spain, and as a revenge in some sort for the recent
attempt made by your ruthless marshal on my
residence here, I know you to be the officer who spared
the mansion of old Don Juan Lerma, when
empowered by your orders to destroy it.  Don Juan is
the only man for whom a lingering feeling of
humanity has left in my breast an atom of regard, for
he loved the old cavalier, my father, well.  Being
anxious to requite to you the kindness so lately done
to him, and to prove whether his gratitude surpasses
that of a robber, I request that you will write to him
from this, my Villa of Aviero, and beg the ransom of
one hundred dollars to free you from my troop, as I
question very much if the state of Massena's
commissariat will enable you to have so much loose cash
about you.'
</p>

<p>
"'You are right, señor; a hundred dollars!
Diable!  I never had so much money at any time.  But
what if the cavalier Lerma refuses?'
</p>

<p>
"'You must die.'
</p>

<p>
"'Morbleu!' said I, shrugging my shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"'Such is the law of capture to which we have
bound ourselves, by such oaths as men seldom hear.
You will be accommodated with writing materials;
address a letter to the Cavalier Don Juan Lerma,
and one of my people will convey it immediately to
the city of Santarem.'
</p>

<p>
"Upon this, I wrote a hurried but anxious note to
the old hidalgo, begging him to consider the
kindness I had done him, the danger by which I was
menaced, and pledging my honour to repay the
hundred duros out of my first prize money.  This
system of kidnapping and extortion had become so
common that, being doubtful of the answer, I saw
the messenger depart with an anxiety which I
laboured in vain to conceal by folding my arms and
planting my feet on the brassero, by smoking a cigar,
sipping the Lisbon vino, and joining in the half
frivolous and wholly ruffian chit-chat of Don Julian
and his squalid myrmidons.
</p>

<p>
"In the midst of this I was a little startled to find
my acquaintance, the Jew dentist, enter, with his
box under his arm, a bloody cloth encircling his
head and half concealing his basilisk eyes, which
bent on me a demoniacal scowl of recognition; and
I discovered to my consternation that this worthy, in
virtue of being a greater fiend than his fellows, was
no other than the lieutenant of Julian d'Aviero.  But,
without seeming to observe me, he advanced to the
side of the latter, and whispered a few words in his
ear.
</p>

<p>
"'Ha,' said Don Julian, 'is it so? then our
hellish compact must be observed.  I am sorry for
the little paisana, but there is no remedy.  Hold,
there, cammarados! bring in the prisoners of
Santarem&mdash;the potter Perez and the girl who was
captured with him last night by our worthy Teniente
Isacco Zendono.'
</p>

<p>
"'The girl is his sister,' growled the Jew robber,
in husky Spanish, as he threw off his blue gown and
revealed his gaudy Spanish dress, and sash bristling
with pistols and knives, 'and a fair sample of mother
Eve's flesh she is&mdash;Bueno!'
</p>

<p>
"'Curses blast you! bring them in, or'&mdash;and
Julian, who always assumed the blustering ruffian to
his own people, grasped a pistol.
</p>

<p>
"The lieutenant quitted his presence; but almost
immediately returned, dragging in a stout peasant
about three or four and twenty years of age.  He had
all the lofty air, the well-knit and erect figure of those
peasantry on frontiers where the Portuguese are
improved by intermarriage with the Spaniards.  He
wore a brown vest with loose sleeves, and breeches of
bright yellow cotton, tied about the middle by a red
silk scarf.  His long raven hair was gathered in a
wide silk netting, and hung in a heavy mass upon his
neck.  His hands were tightly pinioned by a cord,
but he gazed about him with an air of reckless defiance,
which, however, failed to intimidate the thieves,
or to encourage his sister, a pretty-looking girl of
sixteen, or thereabout, who clung to his arm in the
utmost terror.
</p>

<p>
"Her coal-black hair was plaited somewhat after
the fashion of the Basque women, in two gigantic
braids, and reached below the flounces of her yellow
skirt, which was short enough to expose, half-way up
to the knee, her very handsome legs, encased in
bright scarlet stockings which were elaborately
covered with white braiding.  Her little feet and
ankles were equipped with open cut abarcas,
interlaced with thongs of morocco leather, like the hose
of your Highland soldiers.  Her teeth and lips were
a miracle, and her terror made her dark eyes glitter
like diamonds.  Ah! merci, monsieur, she was
excessively captivating, that little paisana.
</p>

<p>
"Though such a little beauty is not uncommon in
Spain, the robbers of Don Julian gazed upon her
with gloating eyes of evil admiration and longing;
many of them licked their huge blubber lips with
grim and grotesque glee, as if anticipating kisses;
while the poor sinking girl shrunk from their bold
and villainous gaze, as she would have done from the
eyes of so many serpents or fiends.
</p>

<p>
"'Teresa, hold up your head, my dear girl; do not
droop before these base ladrones, stained as they are
by a thousand atrocities.  Dios! should innocence
quail before guilt?' said the young peasant with a
fearlessness that at once gained him my sympathy
and admiration; and for a time I forgot my own
troubles in those of the strangers.  'Be bold of heart,
my sweet sister!  We are possessed of that which can
touch even the hearts of these bad men, and unlock
the doors of their prison-house.'
</p>

<p>
"'You are mistaken in this idea, Señor Perez el
Cantarero,' said Don Julian, with a quiet sneer, while
his band crowded round with lowering brows and
gloating eyes.  'Quite mistaken, allow me to inform
you.  Your honest uncle, the abagado (O most honest
lawyer of Santarem!) has refused to ransom you.  Our
messenger, the very reverend rabbi, Isacco Zendono,
has come back just now empty-handed.'
</p>

<p>
"The girl shrieked and hid her face in the bosom
of her brother, who gazed around him with a look of
rage, astonishment, and stupefaction.
</p>

<p>
"Isacco, the Jew, burst into an uncontrollable fit
of laughter, in which Don Julian and his comrades
joined.
</p>

<p>
"'Out upon ye, villains,' exclaimed Perez the potter,
shaking his clenched hand at them.
</p>

<p>
"'O Perez, por amor de mi,' urged his sister, in a
breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
"'Teresa, my poor Teresa,' muttered the brother
through his hard-set teeth, 'I had doubts, dreadful
doubts; but I expected not this.  Answer, Señor Don
Julian d'Aviero, does this black-hearted slave of
Mammon, this villain of an abagado, forget that he
retains in his repositories the inheritance left us by
old Gil Perez, the alcalde of Santarem?'
</p>

<p>
"'In truth, most blustering señor, most valiant
cavalier of crocks and cans, your father's honest
brother has not forgotten that important fact,' replied
Julian d'Aviero, in his cool, dry way.  'The abagado
will act true to his trade, by deceiving those who trust
him.  His trade!  May the great Devil confound it,
for it has stripped me of as fair an heritage as ever
came from a miserly sire to a spendthrift son.  Well,
Señor Perez, in short, to possess himself of your two
thousand dollars, and practise a little profitable
conveyancing, your relative the lawyer has stoutly
declined to ransom you, saith our messenger, swearing
by the bones of St. James, he would not yield the
hundredth part of a pezzo to save you from the jaws
of hell.'
</p>

<p>
"'Be it so,' muttered Perez, between his clenched
teeth; 'in the world that is to come, he will meet with
his reward.'
</p>

<p>
"'Were it but to provoke the abagado, I would
willingly set you free, Señor Potter; but the laws of
this free community say nay.'
</p>

<p>
"'But my sister&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Has found no more favour than yourself.  Santos!
You are a strange fellow, Señor Perez.  Who the
devil ever expects to find an apostle in the carcase of
an abagado?'
</p>

<p>
"'Madre de Dios! my poor Teresa!' said the
young man, folding his sister to his breast; while she
responded by an agony of grief and terror, such as I
had never before witnessed.
</p>

<p>
"On her knees she bent before Julian d'Aviero,
imploring him to spare her only brother, and to slay
her, if he pleased; but her piteous cries and
supplications, rendered yet more plaintive by the beautiful
language of Spain, were drowned by the brutal
jests, and whoops, and yells of the Portuguese robbers.
</p>

<p>
"When the hubbub subsided, 'Señor Cantarero,'
said Don Julian, in his wonted cold and sarcastic
manner, 'I have said that your ransoms are
refused.'
</p>

<p>
"'And what then, Señor Ladrone?' asked the
paisano sternly.
</p>

<p>
"You must die&mdash;that is all," replied the captain,
quietly knocking the ashes from his fragrant cuba.
</p>

<p>
"'Die!'
</p>

<p>
"'Si, morir, Micer Perez el Cantarero,' said he,
with an ironical bow.
</p>

<p>
"''T is hard to die thus, and unrevenged,' said the
peasant, looking round as if for a weapon; 'but I am
content, so that you release my sister, and swear upon
the crucifix that she shall receive no harm.'
</p>

<p>
"At this demand there was another horrid laugh;
and the Jew, turning up his eyes, swore something in
Hebrew at a request so unreasonable.
</p>

<p>
"'Keep your mind quite at ease, Perez, amigo
mio,' said Julian d'Aviero, whose potations were now
affecting his brain, and imparting to his manner a
strange mixture of ferocity and jocose cruelty&mdash;'do
not be alarmed; your sister shall not die.  Maladetto! dost
think we have no taste or discrimination?'
</p>

<p>
"'The Holy Virgin thank you!' said the potter,
with an odd mixture of fervour and ferocity; 'my
dearest Teresa, will&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Fall to the lot of the fortunate rascal to whom
the happy dice assigns her,' said the Jew lieutenant of
the gang, pushing forward and jostling me, with such
insolence that I had some difficulty in keeping my
hands from his throat.
</p>

<p>
"'Hark you, Master Potter,' he continued, in his
husky Spanish, which I cannot imitate.  'We cast
lots for the women we capture, if they be young and
handsome.  The men we poniard, if they cannot
ransom their heads and hides, and then we bury them
honourably in the chasm of the Tagus.  The bones
of some stout fellows are bleaching there, so you will
find yourself in good company, I promise you I owe
you a grudge for the stroke your 'cajado' dealt on my
pate yesterday, and so claim the first blow to-day.
Arrojarse, camarados! fall on!'
</p>

<p>
"He unsheathed his poniard and grasped the potter
by the collar of his buckram doublet; but the
descending blow was arrested by the uplifted arms of
Teresa, who hung upon the villanous dog of Israel
with the determination, if not with the strength, of a
tigress, and poured forth a succession of cries and
threats, which astonished even the intended assassin;
then, sinking upon her knees, the winning girl
pressed the murderer's hideous paw to her beautiful
lips, beseeching him, in those accents to which a
woman in deadly terror can alone give utterance, to
spare her brother, her Perez, her dear and only
brother, and she would become the servant, the slave,
of the robber for her whole life.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, spare my brother; spare him!  O Señor
Judio; O Señor Don Julian, Caballeros, gracias,
bandidos, por Nuestra Señora Santissima!'
</p>

<p>
"'My slave?  Demonios!' chuckled the ruffian
Jew; 'that you may be at all events, or I may make
short work with you, and so disappoint some honest
fellow here.  Off, off with you!' and he shook her
from him with so much violence, that on sinking
to the floor, the blood gushed from her mouth and
nostrils.
</p>

<p>
"The Jew again raised his dagger, but Perez, filled
with fury at the treatment of his sister, snapped, as if
it had been a straw, the cord that bound him, and,
grappling with the athletic ruffian, dashed him on the
floor where he placed a foot upon his breast, and trod
him down as one would do a serpent.  The blood of
the potter was up; grasping another by the sash, he
hurled him back with such force that the bandit was
instantly slain; for, on staggering, his head came so
violently in contact with an angle of the wall, that in
a moment his brains were dashed out, and he presented
a dreadful spectacle as he lay, breathless and
quivering, with his battered skull empty, as if struck
by a grapeshot, and his blood and brains forming an
oozy pool beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Even the banditti seemed struck with horror for
a moment, and a stillness ensued.  They glared at
their dead comrade and at each other, heedless of the
groans and struggles of the half-stifled Zendono.
The voice of the girl was again heard supplicating,
for I had raised her up; and she implored me to save
her brother, for he had done no wrong, but shed
blood only in his own defence, and now remained
motionless and terrified at his own temerity.  The
faint and half-articulate voice of Teresa recalled the
band from the spell which, as I have said, their
comrade's death had cast around them; and
simultaneously they rushed with their knives upon the poor
potter, and, pierced at once by innumerable and
reiterated wounds, he sunk lifeless among their feet;
and long after the last vital spark had fled, they
continued to stab and slash, and otherwise mutilate
the corpse until its bloody garments hung about it
in tatters.
</p>

<p>
"'Tonnere!' thought I, 'if my friend the hidalgo
has neither the cash nor the inclination to ransom
me, I shall be in a bad way.'
</p>

<p>
"By order of Don Julian, who had watched this
scene of butchery with folded arms and an immovable
aspect, the body was tossed over the window,
from whence I heard it falling heavily from rock to
rock before it reached the deep, dark water of a
tributary of the Tagus, that struggled through a
chasm in the cliffs, two hundred feet below.
</p>

<p>
"While the half-drunken banditti cursed and
yelled like fiends, they cast the dead body of their
comrade after that of the unfortunate potter, then
wiped and sheathed their poniards; and all traces of
the horrible occurrence disappeared, save the red
blood gouts upon the floor, which these European
Thugs never thought of cleansing; but trampled to
and fro among that frightful puddle as heedlessly
as if it had been so much spring water spilt by
accident.
</p>

<p>
"Teresa had swooned, and hung on my arm in a
happy state of insensibility.
</p>

<p>
"Isacco Zendono, who had suffered severely in
the melée, during his prostrate position on the floor,
now scrambled up, his heart burning with fury, and
his body smarting with pain.  He was plastered
with the gore of the slain men; and its dripping
from his sable beard and matted hair no way
improved his personal appearance, or increased the
benevolence of his features.
</p>

<p>
"Growling at the weight of his comrades' heels,
he demanded in a stentorian voice that lots should
be cast for possession of the Señora Teresa; a
proposition at once acceded to.
</p>

<p>
"Dice were produced, and the beetle-browed banditti
crowded round a table, where they rattled and
threw the dice in succession.
</p>

<p>
"The Jew uttered a yell.
</p>

<p>
"He had won!
</p>

<p>
"Diable! how like a victorious fiend he seemed,
as, with a shout of villanous joy, he snatched the
poor insensible victim from my arms, and with his
poniard menacing any man who dared to follow,
bore her off, bent double over his left arm, as easily
as he would have done a folded mantle.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Teresa! she was so slight and young.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, I am not quite such a bad or wild
fellow as, perhaps, you may think me; and I do assure
you that I then felt my impetuous blood tingling in
every vein.  I sprang after the dog Zendono, but
was restrained by the powerful and perhaps friendly
arm of Don Julian d'Aviero.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor!' he exclaimed, in a whisper, 'are you
mad?  Remember your life is at stake, and ponder
well on the helplessness of your condition among
us.'
</p>

<p>
"The truth of this came bitterly home to my
heart; I gave the speaker a fierce and reproachful
glance, and folded my arms in silence.
</p>

<p>
"My heart bled for the unhappy girl.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Frequently in that long and dreary night, when
the mountain blast howled drearily through the
shattered villa of Aviero, and moaned in the gorge
through which the Tagus wound, I heard the cries
and lamentations of the miserable girl, and the
oaths and revelry of those to whom she was now
abandoned.
</p>

<p>
"Ere daybreak her cries had ceased.  Mille
Baionettes! they nearly drove me mad.
</p>

<p>
"What became of her I know not, as I never saw
her again.
</p>

<p>
"Next day, an old Padre of Santarem came with
a message from the hidalgo Don Juan Lerma, whose
mansion I had spared.  The priest had volunteered
on this errand of mercy, as no other man in
Santarem would venture within the reach of the terrible
Aviero, to whom he paid two hundred pillared
dollars, and I was conducted to within a few toises of
the advanced sentinels of our out-piquets, by Don
Julian in person, and we bade each other adieu with
a very good grace, but without either tears or regret
on my side, as may be well assumed; and so ended
my mal-adventure in the wood of Santarem."
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Captain St. Florian concluded his story.
</p>

<p>
"Parbleu!" said he, "how dry my throat is with
speaking so long, and I dare say I have tired you to
death.  But let us have one more bottle of Janette's
champagne, and then we shall decamp soberly to
look for more adventures.  But I must be cautious,
being for guard at the chateau to-morrow.  You
cannot mean to return to Lagny to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"I must; and 't is high time we were off, Captain
St. Florian; besides, I see Janette is decidedly
sleepy."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! poor girl, yes."
</p>

<p>
"My horse is at an hotel in a street leading from
the Champ Elysées."
</p>

<p>
"Ouf! a devil of a way from this.  There is a
church clock striking five.  Nombril de Belzebub,
't is morning!"
</p>

<p>
We hurriedly rose to depart.  Janette had fallen
fast asleep in the bar, and St. Florian kissed her
brow as he passed and deposited the reckoning in
her lap.  The portière of the cabaret let us out, and
we sallied through the street to find my hotel.
</p>

<p>
At the chateau, as the Parisians name the palace,
I bade adieu to the captain, and getting forth my
horse, rode off.
</p>

<p>
The trumpets of the Austrian cavalry and the English
drums were ringing on the early morning wind,
as the reveille roused the soldiers of the allied host
in their several camps and cantonments.
</p>

<p>
The patrols of the gensd'armes were retiring to
their quarters; the sun was coming up in his glory,
and ruddily in his morning light, amid the morning
smoke of Paris, shone the huge façade of Notre
Dame, and the burnished dome of the Hotel des
Invalides.
</p>

<p>
Paris, with its tented parks and guarded barriers,
was left behind; and I dashed at full gallop along the
dusty road that under the shadow of many a vine
trellis, and many an apple bower, led to my
cantonments at Lagny on the Marne.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
THE MAJOR'S STORY.
</h3>

<p>
On the Colonel concluding, there arose a contention
between our surgeon, Mac Leechy, and the senior
major, as to who should tell his story first; for "the
steam" was now fairly up; but the matter was adjusted
by seniority, like choice of quarters, or having
the best bed in a billet, and the right of first
mounting a breach, and other little contingencies of a
military life.
</p>

<p>
"I was once nearly hanged by Wellington," said
the Doctor to tempt us to listen; "for when I first
joined the service, it was as an ensign, though I had
my diploma of M.D."
</p>

<p>
"Hanged?" said Slingsby; "then you proved a
King's bad bargain, Doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Not half so bad as you, Jack," retorted our old
medico; "but I'll tell you in a few words how it
came to pass.  When our troops were falling back
from Quatre Bras, upon the village of Waterloo, on
that stormy 17th of June, which preceded the great
battle, I was sent forward with sixteen men of the
Scots Brigade to take possession of the principal inn
as quarters for the Great Duke and his staff, and
to save the house from being plundered or forcibly
seized by any one else.  We entered the village
double-quick: I soon found the inn, and after
posting my sentinels in front and rear, preceded to
investigate (from motives of personal interest) the
contents of the pantry before the Duke arrived.  In
twenty minutes afterwards we heard musket-shots;
I rushed out of the kitchen (where I had been
consoling the terrified landlady, and deviling a
drumstick,) to find my fellows firing at the French
tirailleurs, who were now at the end of the village where
they had lined a stone wall.  We peppered them
briskly; but four of my men had just fallen, when
a Belgian officer, all covered with stars and lace,
galloped up to me, crying, as he took the road to Brussels,
</p>

<p>
"'Fall back&mdash;fall back&mdash;Waterloo is surrounded,
and you will be cut off!'
</p>

<p>
"I drew out my men and left the village double
quick.  At the other end of it, I passed a mounted
general officer with his staff, who were sitting quietly
and composed in their saddles; but he called to me
with a loud voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Halt, sir&mdash;halt your men, and come here!'
</p>

<p>
"I obeyed, and lowered the point of my sword.
Oh, there was no mistaking the keen grey eagle eyes,
the high nose and white neckcloth; the little blue
cloak and brass sabre of this personage.  It was
Wellington himself.
</p>

<p>
"'In God's name, sirrah,' said he, fiercely, 'why
have you abandoned your post?'
</p>

<p>
"'The village is surrounded&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'It is not surrounded&mdash;a few sharpshooters fired
a shot or two at our cavalry, but they have been all
killed or taken.'
</p>

<p>
"'A Belgian officer&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Cowardice&mdash;rank cowardice,' said Wellington.
'and at a time like this!  Provost Marshal&mdash;where
are the Provost Marshal and his guard?  A rope&mdash;get
a rope, and hang this young fellow from the
nearest tree.'
</p>

<p>
"I was in deadly terror, for I was then a raw lad,
and did not perceive that this was, perhaps, only to
frighten me; but at that moment Sir Denis Pack
dashed up with some intelligence which was of more
importance to Europe than the hanging of Ensign
Mac Leechy, so Wellington troubled himself no
more about me; I shrunk away to pick my
half-devilled bone and to rejoin the Scots Brigade, who
were bivouacked in a field near the Brussels road.
</p>

<p>
"Soon after Waterloo, I exchanged my ensign's
commission for a medical one, and have never since been
in terror of being hanged by a Provost, or shot by a
court martial."
</p>

<p>
"Tush," said the major, "I was once nearer being
hanged than you, doctor; for I was tried, and
sentenced, and, moreover, only escaped one noose to be
caught by another&mdash;for I got my wife by it."
</p>

<p>
Our major was a jolly and cozy old fellow, who was
addicted to a little flirtation with married dames of
mature age, and to making downright love to widows
(if his good lady was absent), and invariably opened
the trenches by affecting to consider them the sisters
of their handsome daughters.  He was a great
favorite with us all; but, being married, he never dined
at mess, unless when specially invited by some one.
Thus we warmly welcomed our old major's story,
which he began without further preamble.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
"ESTELLA."
</h3>

<p>
"I entered the service," quoth the Major, "when
the Peninsular War was at its height, and my
commission was signed by the first gentleman in Europe,
then Prince Regent; truly we had queer ideas of
what constituted a gentleman in those days,
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "'In my hot youth, when George III. was king.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I joined our first battalion in Spain, and had more
than enough of marching, fighting, and starving in
the desolate province of Estremadura, where Marshal
Macdonald and General Foy never gave us a moment
to spare.  I was wounded at La Nava, and at the
storming of Almarez.  When I scrambled over the
palisades, with my sword-arm in a sling, I remember
a voltigeur officer rushing upon me with his sabre
uplifted; but, on perceiving my wound, he lowered
his weapon gracefully in salute, and passed on to
encounter another.  We took the garrison prisoners,
blew up the works, and threw the guns into the
Tagus.  At night, when we buried the dead, by
flinging them into their own trenches, I was shocked
to perceive my generous and gallant voltigeur among
them&mdash;cold and stiff&mdash;slain by a shot in his heart,
and with his right hand still grasping the hilt of the
same sabre with which he had threatened and so
chivalrously spared me.  I was at the defence of
Alba, and with the covering army at Badajoz, and I
fought at Victoria, where our colonel, the gallant
Cadogan, was killed, and where we put up a statue to
his memory; but so unlike him, that I am sure if
the good man ever looks at it out of Heaven, he will
never recognise himself.
</p>

<p>
"We had always hard fighting, for I belonged to
the light troops; and so far as the head was
concerned in those days, I was very well adapted for
that branch of the service.
</p>

<p>
"My regiment, the Highland Light Infantry, belonged
to the first brigade of the second division of infantry
(Sir Rowland Hill's), and at the time when this little
narrative opens was quartered at Aranjuez, a small
town of Toledo, about twenty miles south of Madrid,
on the left bank of the Tagus.  Though we had
been for some months in quarters of refreshment on
the Portuguese frontier, and had there received
several supplies of clothing, &amp;c., from Britain, in
consequence of the rapid movements of the army,
which, by turning the positions on the Ebro and
Douro, had driven back the French under Joseph
and Jourdan, making them to traverse the whole
length of Spain in one short month, and the
incessant activity of the light troops, my uniform was
reduced to a mere mass of rags.  My cap, a kind of
Highland bonnet, checquered, but without feathers
(like that still retained by the 71st and 74th
Regiments), was worn into many holes, and the rain came
through upon my head.  My epaulettes, or wings,
were reduced to black wire; my coatee, turned to
purple and black, was, like my Tartan trews, patched
with cloth of every hue; my sash had shrunk to
a remnant; the pipeclay had long disappeared from
my shoulder-belt, and the sheath of my claymore was
worn away until six inches of the bare blade stuck
through it And such was the general appearance of
the officers of our regiment, as, with our canvas
haversacks, our blankets and cloaks slung in our
sashes, and carrying wooden canteens, similar to
those of the privates, we marched into Aranjuez, and
defiled, with pipes playing and drums beating,
towards the great summer palace of Philip II., which
occupies a little island formed by the Tagus and
the Xarama, and is surrounded by the most beautiful
pleasure-grounds.
</p>

<p>
"In one hand I carried my sword, in the other
a ham, which I had picked up when overhauling
a French caisson.  My lieutenant had a small
wine-skin, and my ensign a round loaf under his arm;
thus, we, the officers of the 1st company, looked
forward, to what we deemed, in those hard times, a
sumptuous repast, on halting in the quadrangle of
the vast and silent palace, from which Joseph and his
court had fled but a few hours before, leaving behind
many a sign of their hasty departure.  Here lay
Turkey carpets half torn up; there, velvet hangings
but half torn down; in one room were bales of
furniture, ornaments, and plate, packed but abandoned;
in another lay the remains of a sumptuous feast,
the wine was yet in the half-emptied glass; the fork
remained in the breast of the turkey; the ashes
of a large fire yet smouldered in the vast kitchen,
and in each apartment of these long and magnificent
suites, which traverse the whole palace of
Philip II., were splendid Parisian clocks, with their
gilt pendulums yet wagging under crystal shades,
and all remaining in statu quo, just as the French
fugitives had left them, on the approach of our
advanced guard.
</p>

<p>
"We chose our apartment, seized utensils, and, after
a bath in the sandy Xarama to refresh us after our
long and dusty march, we sat down to a supper on
my ham, the ensign's loaf, and the lieutenant's skin
of the country wine.  Fresh from the royal gardens
we took fruit in abundance; for the season was
summer, and the purple grape, the golden apple, and the
ruddier orange, with the ripe pomegranate, were all
to be had at arm's length from the tall, painted
windows.  Nor were cigars wanting: for, when
investigating the contents of a certain press, I found
several boxes, from which we supplied ourselves, and
gave the remainder to the men of our company, who
were solacing themselves in the adjacent apartments,
and lounging on the velvet sofas, down ottomans, and
satin fauteuils, on which the fair demoiselles of the
usurper's court had sat but the day before.
</p>

<p>
"The quarter-guards were set; the out-pickets had
been posted in the direction of the enemy; in the
palace court, our ten pipes had sounded for the tatoo,
and, wearied to excess, we lay down, some on beds,
and some on benches, but many more on the hard
floor, where we slept soundly, and heedless of the
advancing, the marching, and skirmishing of the
morrow; for we light troops had always our full share of
the latter.
</p>

<p>
"I was in this luxurious state&mdash;for dry quarters,
and a sound sleep after a hearty meal, are great
luxuries to the campaigner&mdash;when I was shaken by the
shoulder, and I heard the devilish voice of our
sergeant-major saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'I beg your pardon, Captain &mdash;&mdash;; the first officer
for duty is required to take convalescents to the rear
They march an hour before daylight, and the adjutant
sent me to warn you, sir, and say, the piper will blow
the rouse in twenty minutes.'
</p>

<p>
"He retired, having delivered his orders; and then,
as a pleasant sequel to them, I heard the rain&mdash;the
heavy rain of Castile, where every drop is the size of
a walnut&mdash;pattering on the long range of palace
windows which faced the east.  No man ever left a warm
down bed more unwillingly than did I the hard tiled
floor of the sala.  I rolled up my cloak and blanket,
slung them with my haversack and canteen, and then
groped about for a small portmanteau which contained
all my goods and gear; and, without disturbing my
two comrades to bid them 'good-bye'&mdash;for, poor
fellows! after so long a march as that of yesterday, to
have done so would have been positive inhumanity&mdash;with
half-closed eyes, I hurried along, stumbling
over the sleeping soldiers, muskets, knapsacks, and
broken furniture with which the vast halls and suites
of chambers were encumbered.  After losing myself
for a time in that famous apartment of mirrors, where
Godoy and the Queen were wont to perform fandangos,
I reached the bridge of Toledo, as it is named
from the road which crosses it; and there I found
the convalescents assembling, in the dark of a cold
and rainy morning, for daylight was yet an hour
distant, and I heard the heavy drops battering the tarred
canvas covers of the wretched caissons, wherein the
sick and wounded lay.  I heard the rain also lashing
on the parapets of the bridge, and raising bubbles on
the rapid stream which swept below its arches.
</p>

<p>
"There were not less than thirty waggons or bullock-cars
filled by officers alone, many of them sick, or
suffering from diseases produced by hardship and
starvation; others from wounds, and the amputation
of legs and arms, by the stupid apothecaries' boys,
who composed almost wholly our medical staff in the
Peninsula.  In rags and misery, almost shirtless and
shoeless, they lay closely packed in the caissons
among a little straw; and one&mdash;the weakest and
most reduced&mdash;was the famous Irish assistant-surgeon,
Maurice Quill, of the 31st Regiment.  I had
one officer of the 1st Dragoon Guards, who, being mad
as a March hare, had an entire waggon to himself, and
I heard him bellowing like a wild bull, above the
rushing rain and the howling wind as I approached
this mournful assemblage on the old bridge of Toledo.
</p>

<p>
"I received the lists and commissariat papers, &amp;c.,
in the dark, from the brigade-major, who carried a
lantern under his cloak, and, in bidding me adieu,
bade me beware of Barba Roxa, or Red-bearded
Sancho, a thief, whose exploits were then making some
noise in Toledo and La Mancha.  The few soldiers
who accompanied me were also convalescents, on
their way home to be discharged, and, consequently,
were barely able to carry their arms.  I had a French
troop horse, captured in the scramble at Arroyo del
Molino, and by my side rode the only effective man
in the detachment, my orderly dragoon; who, for the
good service he rendered me by his inborn bravery
and fidelity, I shall ever remember with gratitude,
Darby Crogan, a private of the 4th, or Royal Irish
Dragoon Guards, and when I say he was every inch
a true Irish soldier, further comment is needless.
</p>

<p>
"Though we had enough and to spare of fighting, I
own that it was with no ordinary feeling of dissatisfaction
I departed on this duty, leaving my comrades
to push on towards the south, to fight and win the
great battle of Vittoria, and drive the French from
Spain; while I had the foreknowledge that there was
never an instance known of an officer leaving the
army, in charge of convalescents, without being
involved in the most serious quarrels with the Spanish
authorities, both civil and military.  But there was
no alternative for me; so, muffling myself in my
cloak, after sharing with Darby Crogan a glass of
brandy from a certain convenient flask, which hung
at my waist-belt, and after a good deal of galloping
to and fro, swearing at muleteers and bullock-drivers,
the cars were put in motion, and the march began
just as the first streak of dawn glimmered dimly
above the distant sierras.
</p>

<p>
"A company of Les Chasseurs Brittaniques (who,
though French deserters and ragamuffins of every
kind, wore the red British uniform), under a Captain
H&mdash;&mdash;, marched also for Ciudad Real, and nearly at
the same time, but were ordered to pursue a route
apart from mine, by Santa Cruz de la Zarza, and down
the other side of the mountains, by Corral de
Almuguer and Madridejos.
</p>

<p>
"The morning had broken clear and cloudless,
when, passing through an open tract of country, we
reached Yepes, and the summer sun of Castile came
up in all his burning glory.  I generally rode about
fifty yards in front of my party to avoid the incessant
complaints and cries of the sick and wounded, whose
ailments or sores were exasperated by the increasing
heat and pitiless jolting of the bullock-cars, which
had neither springs nor iron axles.  The day was
cloudless and scorching; the plain hot, dry, and
dusty, all vegetation being burned out of it.  No
breeze came from the distant mountains; but a vast
swarm of black flies, which floated like a vapour
about us, gave incredible annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"A poor young officer (lieutenant in an English
light cavalry regiment) expired under the pain of his
mortifying wounds and accumulated sufferings.  This
event caused a temporary halt.  By the side of the
mule-track, which crossed that arid plain, we hastily
made a little grave, about a foot deep, and laid him
down, yet warm, in his uniform, and coffinless.  A
little of the blood-stained straw from the waggons was
spread over his face, and then we covered him up,
heaping the dry dusty soil over him by our feet, by
the butts of muskets, and blades of bayonets, to keep
the wolves from disturbing his rest.  Near this lonely
grave there flowed a little fountain from a rude stone
duct, which had been made in the days of old, 'en
tiempo antique,' as a mule-driver told me.  In twenty
minutes after, we were all again en route, with the
mule-bells jangling and the wheels jarring, as if
nothing had happened; but his place in the waggon
was soon supplied, as every hour some of my
convalescent guard became unable to endure the weight of
their trappings, and had to be placed among the sick.
Thus our progress was so slow that night was closing
before we entered La Guardia, a small town, about
sixteen miles from Aranjuez.
</p>

<p>
"As we clambered and toiled up the rocky ridge
which it crowns, on the right bank of the Cedron,
Crogan and I, who rode in front, were surprised to
find the little town almost deserted, and that a few of
the inhabitants who had lingered until we were close
at hand, were retiring from it on the other side, some
on foot and others on mules, but all bearing away
their goods and chattels, beds and furniture.
Entering, we found it empty; and as there were neither
alcalde nor alguazils to go through the farce of
distributing billets, we quartered ourselves wherever we
best could.  After conveying all the wounded from
the waggons into the great convent (I carried Dr. Quill
on my back, for he was weak as a child), there we
laid them, in rows, on the tiled floors; and, after
filling their canteens with water, left them to warm
themselves the best way they could, for we were
wearied almost to death by the slow loitering march
of the past day, under a scorching Castilian sun.
</p>

<p>
"La Guardia is surrounded by a strong but ruinous
fortified wall, which was built in the olden time to
defend the district from the incursions of the Moors;
and at each end it had a gate, whereon I posted a
guard of a corporal and three men; for as the whole
country swarmed with thieves and guerilla deserters,
I knew not what picaros might be lurking in the old
gypsum quarries near the Cedron.
</p>

<p>
"Darby Crogan and I took possession of a deserted
house in the main street.  He lighted a fire, and
being scarce of fuel, made pretty free use of the
doors and shutters, chairs and tables; and we broiled
on a ramrod, or boiled in a camp-kettle, our poor
ration beef, sprinkling it with flour, and eating it
without salt, for that was a commodity extremely
scarce among us in Spain; hence, the flavour of our
commissariat beef, after being carried in a canvas
haversack, on a long day's march, under a burning
sun, would have driven Soyer or his majesty of Oude
into fits.
</p>

<p>
"We had scarcely concluded this miserable meal,
which we shared fraternally&mdash;for on service, though
discipline is never forgotten, the officer and private
are more blended together, as real soldierly sentiment
replaces empty etiquette&mdash;when we were startled
by the report of two or three muskets in our
immediate vicinity.
</p>

<p>
"'Hollo!' said Crogan, springing to the door
of the house, 'the inimy 'ill be on us before we can
say peas!'
</p>

<p>
"'Some guerillas, or picaros, or perhaps, Barba
Roxa,' said I, setting down my flask of aguardiente,
to listen.
</p>

<p>
"'Darby Roxy!&mdash;sure it 'ill be pleasant to meet a
namesake.'
</p>

<p>
"'Not if he beats up our quarters, when we are in
so poor a condition to resist any who might attempt
it; and the watches and rings, &amp;c., of so many sick
officers are booty enough for a few enterprising
Spaniards, who might try to knock the guard on the
head.  Look to our pistols, Crogan; bring up the
horses, and we will ride forth to reconnoitre.'
</p>

<p>
"'Right, yer honour&mdash;I'm the man,' replied the
active Irishman, as he looked to the priming of our
pistols, loaded his carbine, and hurried to the shed
close by, where our horses were chewing their
rations of chopped straw; he saddled, and brought
them to the door; and thus, in three minutes, we
were both mounted.  Meanwhile, the guards at each
gate of the little town had turned out; and, leaving
word to get the whole party under arms in the street,
accompanied by Crogan, I rode at a rapid trot
towards that direction in which the flashes had been
seen by our sentinels.
</p>

<p>
"La Guardia lay buried in obscurity; the night was
dark, and a thin vapour veiled the stars; but no
moon was visible, though at times a red meteor
flashed across the sky.  As the warm night-wind
passed over the vast tracts of waste and untilled
land, it was laden with the rich aroma of those
innumerable little plants like mignionette, which
flourish by the wayside in all the wild parts of
Spain.
</p>

<p>
"'Soft ground, sir,' said Crogan, as his horse
stumbled among the dry-scorched soil; 'by the
holy! this is just like still-hunting, only the bog, bad
luck to it! is as dhry as a bone.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hush!' said I, reining in my horse; 'do you
not hear something?'
</p>

<p>
"'By my troth I do,'replied Darby; and as he
spoke, a musket flashed about a quarter of a mile
distant; and then we heard a faint cry, like a
woman's.
</p>

<p>
"'There are no French in this neighbourhood,'
said I, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"'But plinty of thaves and robbers, sir; and a nice
meetin' it 'id be for us.'
</p>

<p>
"'Forward!' said I; 'we must just take them, like
our wives, Crogan, for better or worse.'
</p>

<p>
"'And, like the wives, a sorry takin' it may be for
some of us,' said Darby, with a reckless laugh, as we
rode on in the dark; and reaching the skirt of a
cork wood, found a large Spanish coach, drawn by two
mules&mdash;such a turn-out as one might have met in
those days on the prados of Seville or Madrid&mdash;being
ransacked by five or six ruffians, armed with
pistols, knives, and carbines.  A man lay dead among
the long grass, near the trees; the mules were kicking
and plunging in the traces; and while one
ruffian dragged out two ladies, the others were cutting
open and emptying their portmanteaus.  I drew my
a word.
</p>

<p>
"'Make your horse rear, sir, the moment we are
fired at,' cried Crogan, who was a practised trooper&mdash;'
'twas by not doing so that Corporal Lanigan, of
ours, got a ball in his chest, at Talavera&mdash;his first
battle too.'
</p>

<p>
"'Forward!' cried I, 'cut them down!'
</p>

<p>
"'Whoop&mdash;hubaboo! this baste ov mine 'ud clear
the rock of Cashel at one spring!' exclaimed Crogan,
who uttered an Irish yell, as we fell suddenly on the
marauders; and though we were but two to six,
routed them in a moment.  Three shots were fired
at us: I cut one fellow across the hand, and severed
his fingers, which grasped the barrel of his musket;
Darby stretched another among the grass, and,
whether scared by his Irish shout, our sudden onset,
or the dread that there were more of us, I know not
but in a twinkling they had vanished into the wood,
and we sprang from our horses to assist the ladies.
</p>

<p>
"'Ay de mi! señor oficial!' cried the younger,
grasping me by the left arm; 'a thousand prayers
and thanks.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ay! mi señor Caballero, muchias gracias,' added
the elder, making a stately, but profound curtsy to
Crogan.
</p>

<p>
"'Why, mam, you make a regular Irish dip,' said
he, raising his hand to the peak of his helmet
'But, sure you've dhropped something,' he added,
picking up a flask.  'Oh, it can't be this, at
all&mdash;aggadenty, the thafe!  Hurroo! it's like raal Cork,
but out of a bran-new cask.'
</p>

<p>
"The old lady now turned to me, perceiving that
I was the officer, and prayed 'el santo de las santos,'
and all the saints in heaven might bless us, for
our courageous and timely succour.
</p>

<p>
"'We are on our way to Ciudad Real from
Madridejos, and were attacked in the wood.  My señor
escudero was shot, our outriders fled; and the
ladrones would undoubtedly have maltreated me&mdash;not
that I cared for myself, señor, but my dear little
goddaughter&mdash;la nina&mdash;the child&mdash;la nina Estella.
It was all for her that I trembled'&mdash;and so forth.
</p>

<p>
"By the moon, which glinted for a time through
the hazy clouds, I could perceive that the speaker
was a middle-aged lady, very dark complexioned; and,
though not handsome, possessing a tolerably good,
even stately presence; and that her goddaughter,
whose features were blanched by terror, had fine
dark Spanish eyes, and a graceful figure, though
somewhat undersized.
</p>

<p>
"I begged of them to be no longer alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"'Señoras,' said I, 'my detachment is at La
Guardia, close at hand; allow me to offer my escort
to you, so far as Ciudad Real, for that, also, is my
destination.'
</p>

<p>
"'We owe you a thousand thanks, señor oficial,'
replied the gentle voice of la nina Estella, who
seemed to be somewhere about eighteen.  'Oh, I
shall never forget that fellow's red beard!  Madre de
Dios, what a size and colour it was!'
</p>

<p>
"'O ho! then our friend was Sancho himself.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, señor,' said the old lady, 'how happily we
will avail ourselves of your kind offer.'
</p>

<p>
"'Good&mdash;I shall have pleasant companions for
the remainder of this most unpleasant journey,'
thought I, beginning to repack the half-rifled mails.
</p>

<p>
"'We are travelling in great haste,' said the señora.
'Is your detachment composed of horse or foot,
caballero?'
</p>

<p>
"'It partakes of both, señora; being thirty
waggons of sick and wounded.'
</p>

<p>
"'Sick and wounded!  O madre de Dios! 'tis
quite a travelling hospital; thirty waggons&mdash;a
lazarretto&mdash;and I have lost my priceless relic of
St. Margarida the Scot.  Oh, señor valaroso, we owe
you a million of favours, but will rather proceed
alone.  And here is this rogue, Pedro, come back
with his mule.  Ah, false coward, to leave your
young mistress in such peril.  I will have you well
beaten when we reach Ciudad Real; I will, sir.
What would have become of us, but for the
miraculous arrival of the señor oficial?'
</p>

<p>
"While I assisted the trembling Pedro to restrap
the portmanteaus, and put the mules in order, a
colloquy was proceeding between Darby Crogan, and
the Spaniard whom he had levelled when the fray
first began.
</p>

<p>
"'Silence, now,' I heard him say, while striking
the butt of his carbine to shake the priming; 'it
will soon be all over wid ye; so die aisy&mdash;do, and
don't be bothering me.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ay, por amor de Dios, Señor Inglese,' implored
the Spaniard on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor Inglese, indeed!' said Darby, testily, as
the aquardiente mounted into his brain; 'is it an
Englishman you'd call me, you rascally Spaniard,
and I, praise God! a dacent Irishman, like my
father and mother before me?'
</p>

<p>
"'Ay de mi, Señor Dragone&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Dragon, is it, now!  I have a name, Mr. Spaniard,
as good as your own, for lack of a better, and that is
Darby Crogan, ould Widda Crogan's boy, at the four
cross roads, near the bog of &mdash;&mdash;; but what am I
prating about?  To make a long story short,
prepare for your wooden surtoo, and make a clane
breast you spalpeen of the earth, you!'
</p>

<p>
"'Come, come, Darby,' said I, 'let him go; he is
only a poor rascal of a Murcian.'
</p>

<p>
"'It's only makin' game of him I am, your
honour; but sure I am that his being, as you say, a
marchent won't make him feel dyin' a bit more,'
replied Darby, uncocking his carbine with an air of
discontent.  'Richly he desarves to die, for he fired
his pistols at me twice; the curse of Cromwell be
on him!'
</p>

<p>
"'Away now,' said I, pointing to the wood;
'vayan usted con Dios, or demonic, if it suits you
better; and see, villain, that we meet no more!'
</p>

<p>
"With a dark gleam in his eye the disarmed robber
slunk away, and I saw that his face, where not streaked
with blood from Darby's sword cut, was ghastly pale
with hate, fear, and fury.
</p>

<p>
"We placed the ladies in their antique caravan-looking
coach; buckled their baggage on the pyramidal
top thereof; furnished Pedro and another servant
with the arms and ammunition of the two robbers;
promised to see the unfortunate escudero interred, a
promise which we never performed; and after escorting
them some miles beyond the cork wood, bade
them adieu, receiving a pressing invitation to visit
them at Ciudad Real, 'where every one knew Donna
Emerenciana de Alcala-de-los-Gazules,' which name I
give myself no small credit for remembering.  We
then returned to La Guardia, and for a time thought
no more of the affair.
</p>

<p>
"I had ordered the drum to be beaten before daylight,
but it was not until two hours after it that the
whole of the sick and wounded were again stowed
into their waggons, and en route; for in the
back-garden of the convent we had to bury those whom
we found dead.
</p>

<p>
"Then again began that melancholy chorus of
groans and cries of pain, mingled with curses in
English and Spanish, the cracking of whips, and
jingle of bells, as the obstinate mules and lazy
bullocks, which drew the rude cars, were urged to motion;
and over wretched roads we departed from La Guardia,
towards the mountains.
</p>

<p>
"Passing over the ground of the last night's
adventure, Crogan picked up something which glittered
amongst the grass; it proved to be the portrait of a
young lady, in a veil, flowing over a high comb; and
in her well-arched eyebrows, fine dark eyes, roguish
mouth, and fascinating smile, I recognised Donna
Estella.
</p>

<p>
"'Bravo! a delightful souvenir of La Guardia,'
said I; and, after admiring it for a time, consigned it
to my breast-pocket.  'Darby, I will owe you a dollar
for this when I draw on the paymaster.'  I gazed at
it frequently on the march, and every time I did so
ray interest in the original increased (but bah! do
not think I was fool enough to fall in love with a
mere miniature), and I resolved that if she was to be
found in Ciudad Real I would certainly discover and
visit her.
</p>

<p>
"Again a black cloud of flies covered the whole of
us; several cars broke down; and such was the terrible
nature of the road that one fell entirely over a
precipice, bullocks, wounded, and all; and then so
great was the delay occasioned by the various
casualties, that evening came on before we reached Mora,
which is only ten miles from La Guardia.  So the
reader may have some idea of the tedium of our progress.
</p>

<p>
"Mora I found also abandoned by its inhabitants,
who fled at our approach, carrying with them all
provisions and everything else which could be borne
away.  Many of the houses appeared to have been
recently burned, for flames were yet smouldering in
three of them, and in another two men were lying
dead; one shot, the other bayoneted.  Being certain
that there were no French in the neighbourhood, or
nearer than Burgos and Navarre, I was at a loss to
comprehend the source of this terror and outrage:
but, influenced by anxiety to be nearer Ciudad Real,
and to have my defenceless detachment disposed of
for that night, I pushed on, in hope of reaching a
small village, which, as my 'route' indicated, lay
about ten miles further off.
</p>

<p>
"Descending from Mora, we traversed a plain which
lies between two sierras that terminate at Porzuna, in
La Mancha: and if our progress was slow by day, it
was slower still by night.  The heat was yet
excessive; a thick impalpable dust floated about us; the
air was close and still; there was not a breath of
wind.  Our thirst was intense, and a murmur of
satisfaction arose from my mournful cavalcade when the
blackened sky, and the croaking of the frogs,
announced rain; and when it did come, it came in
torrents.  Then, raising the covers of the waggons, the
wretched patients thrust out their pallid faces and
trembling hands to catch the heavy drops.  The
dusty plain soon became transformed into a sea of
mud, and the poor convalescent guard sank above
their ankles at every step, while, deeper still, the
mules went above their fetlocks.
</p>

<p>
"Anxious and impatient, accompanied by my orderly,
I rode forward a few miles, but failed to discover
the said village; the whole district was desolate,
and being without a guide, I feared that we had
lost the way.  On returning I found matters still
worse; for, taking advantage of my absence, the
villanous Spaniards, by a preconcerted arrangement,
had simultaneously cut the traces of their mules and
bullocks, and (though my guard shot a few of them
in the attempt) had fled, leaving the sick and wounded
to die in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say whether anger or despair was my
prevailing emotion; but to be left thus, with three
or four-and-twenty waggons (for their number was
now reduced), full of sick and dying men, among the
mountains of Toledo, without provisions, and without
a medical officer, was not very pleasant.  Though
the rain was still falling, as it falls only in Spain
(like one ceaseless and tremendous shower-bath),
Crogan and I departed at a gallop after the runaways,
but could only overtake one; and, as he would
neither halt nor obey us, we fired at him with our
pistols, and, breaking his leg, left him in the same
condition he had left so many of our comrades.
</p>

<p>
"Aware that not a moment should be lost in
procuring a fresh team, we turned in the direction of
Toledo, and ascended the sierra, half blinded by the
rain which lashed in our faces, and, by swelling the
streams from the hills, was fast making the valley
between them a sheet of water
</p>

<p>
"'A fine thing it will be, your honour,' said
Crogan&mdash;'for I'm just in the mood to be savage&mdash;if we
fall in with the Rapparees that rummaged over the
ould lady, last night, and sacked Mora and La
Guardia.'
</p>

<p>
"'Never mind, Darby, my boy, you will die in the
bed "of honour" then.'
</p>

<p>
"'Divil a one of me cares&mdash;though, by my sowl,'
he added, as our horses plashed fetlock-deep in
water, 'I would like that same bed of yer honour's
to be a dhry one.'
</p>

<p>
"'So would I, Darby, but remember&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Why should we be melancholy, boys,<br />
  Whose business 'tis to&mdash;&mdash;die?'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'By the hokey! that ditty sounds very like as if
the man that made it, sir, had been up to his neck in
a bog at the time.  But there are lights!'
</p>

<p>
"'And the rain is abating, too.'
</p>

<p>
"To be brief.  After a ten miles' ride, we reached
Almonacid de Zorita, a small town of New Castile,
where we roused the alcalde from his bed.  He
summoned his alguazils, and they, after an infinite deal
of trouble, collected by impress all the cattle in the
place, amounting to about twenty mules, and as
many bullocks.  The alcalde assisted us with
ill-concealed reluctance, and told me that he and the
alcalde of Mora had that morning transmitted to the
commandant at Ciudad Real an account of certain
outrages, and lawless impressment of mules,
committed by a British detachment, at Mora and La
Guardia.'
</p>

<p>
"'You must mistake, Señor Alcalde,' said I,
angrily, for I was drenched to the skin at the time;
'the only plunderers of La Guardia, if I may judge
from personal experience, are true Castilians.'
</p>

<p>
"'The Marquis of Santa Cruz shall judge,' said
the alcalde, showing us to the door.  'Adieu,
señores.'
</p>

<p>
"'Good-bye, old gentleman, and bad manners to
you,' said Crogan, as we leaped on our horses, and,
recrossing the sierra reached the waggons about
daybreak: and though sleepless and exhausted, I was
but too happy when the new team was traced to them,
and the whole were once more on their way towards
La Mancha.
</p>

<p>
"Slowly and wearily we toiled on by the banks of
the Algador, and again crossing the mountains, near
a lake into which it flows, reached Guadalerza, all
but overcome by heat and fatigue.  I remember that
near the lake (which was literally alive with adders
and small snakes) there stood a solitary convent;
and as we passed its walls, the fair recluses waved
their handkerchiefs from their narrow gratings, with
many a cry of 'viva los Inglesos,' so long as we were
within hearing.  From Guadalerza, fortunately, the
inhabitants had not fled, and they answered promptly
and readily the piteous cries of our sufferers for
water, which was supplied to them in crocks and
jars, that were filled and emptied as if to quell a
conflagration.
</p>

<p>
"The village of Fuentelfresno, which overlooks
those sands from whence the Guadiana is supposed
to spring, was our next halting-place, but its
miserable and impoverished inhabitants were totally
unable to afford us rations of any kind; and there
several of the wounded, whose sabre-cuts or
gun-shot wounds, by the jolting of the waggons, had
broken out afresh, expired.  There were two officers
and four soldiers, whom we buried in one hole (alas! I
cannot call it a grave), under an old orange-tree, near
the Jarama.  Finding that it was useless to halt in a
place where we were in danger of starving, we went
further on, and bivouacked nine miles beyond it.
near a little runnel of spring water, on a fine green
plain.  The soundest sleep that ever closed my eyes
was enjoyed there, on that soft grassy sward, beside
my horse's heels; but I cannot omit to mention the
terror by which it was broken.
</p>

<p>
"My charger snorted, reared, and tried madly to
break away from the peg to which I had picketted him.
</p>

<p>
"I raised myself on inv elbow, and looked around
me.  The waggons were all closely drawn up side by
side: the escort were sleeping among their piled
arms, and, muffled in their great-coats, our four
sentinels stood motionless, about three hundred yards
distant.  The moonlight was clear and beautiful.
Suddenly something reared its head close beside me;
I shrunk under my blanket, and, lo! a frightful
snake, nearly fifteen feet long, passed over the whole
bivouac, hissing and gliding; but, fortunately, without
biting any one, it disappeared into a little thicket
of laurels and underwood which grew near us.
</p>

<p>
"'Och, this Spain!&mdash;snakes, too&mdash;divil mend it!'
I heard Crogan muttering in his sleep; 'more ov it
yet! and I have never had a raal good potato down
my throat since I came into it.'
</p>

<p>
"Next day, the sun-burnt plains of La Mancha lay
before us; but ere the intense heat of noon, we
reached Fernancaballero, in the partida of
Piedrabueno; and there (so exhausted were my soldiers,
and so terrible the complaints of the wounded),
though my route permitted me to tarry but one night,
I was compelled to halt for two additional days, an
indulgence which nearly cost me my life.  In the
early morning, when visiting the quarters of the sick
and wounded, to render them any assistance in my
power before marching, I became aware that a person
was following me through the dark, muddy, and
unpaved streets of the mountain Puebla.
</p>

<p>
"As a soldier, habitually cautious, and, as a
campaigner, aware of the Spanish character, I grasped
the hilt of my Highland sword, and walked watchfully on.
</p>

<p>
"This man, by whom I had certainly been dogged
and followed for some time, was now joined by two
others, and the three accompanied my steps, remaining
close behind.  Crogan was looking after our
horses, and I had no other orderly or attendant; but
resolving that if their intentions were bad to anticipate
them, I halted, and confronting the trio, said, as
if without suspicion.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Señores, que hora es?'
</p>

<p>
"'Son los quatro, Caballero,' replied one, gaping at
me with surprise on being so suddenly accosted; but
I saw the ominous gleam of two knives, as they were
secretly drawn from the broad worsted sashes of his
companions, who skilfully endeavoured to conceal the
act.  Quick as lightning, drawing a pistol from my
belt, I fired a bullet right at the head of one, whose
enormous red beard the flash revealed to me.  The
hall tore open his cheek, and carried away his left
ear.  His comrade rushed upon me, but I received
him by thrusting the muzzle into his mouth, and
hurling him furiously back.  On this they all took to
flight; but not before I perceived that the wounded
man had his left hand swathed in a bandage.
</p>

<p>
"'O ho, Señor Sancho, la Barba Roxa!' said I,
recognising the robber whom I had maimed at La
Guardia; 'I thought your voice was not unfamiliar
to me.'
</p>

<p>
"I hurried to the muster-place, in a frame of mind
that struggled between wrath at my narrow escape,
and triumph at the victory I had won; but, in ten
minutes after, the drum beat, and, replacing the sick
in the waggons, we moved off.
</p>

<p>
"Our march of fifteen miles from Fernancaballero
we got rapidly over; for Crogan and I having found
no less than twenty-five mules grazing near the
Alzuer, which there flows through a fertile, plain,
many of them bridled, as if just abandoned by their
riders, we yoked them to the waggons, and entering
Ciudad Real, the capital of La Mancha, passed at a
rapid pace through its broad, straight, and well-paved
streets, to the great Plaza, or principal square.
</p>

<p>
"'The Lord be praised!' thought I, as the train
halted, and I gave in my papers to the Spanish
town-major, Don José Gonzales y Llano, a field-officer of
that regiment of Leon, which fled, en masse, from the
field of Vittoria.  'My duty and my troubles are
over together.'
</p>

<p>
"But I was grievously mistaken, as I might have
augured from the manner of the town-major, who
curled his mustaches, and shifted from one foot
to the other, like a man who has something
unpleasant to say, but dares not.
</p>

<p>
"While the occupants of the waggons were being
conveyed to hospital by fatigue-parties of Spanish
soldiers, and my guard joined a detachment of
convalescents, who, under another officer, were on their
march towards the castle of Belem.  I soon became
aware that I was an object of marked attention to
the denizens of Ciudad Real.  A vast crowd had
gathered in the Plaza, and I saw many men, particularly
paisanos, gesticulating violently, and pointing
to me, while the muttering gradually rose into shouts
of 'Maldetto! mueran los Inglesos!  Perro! ladrone! bandido!'
</p>

<p>
"'What the devil is the meaning of all this?'
thought I; and indignantly pushed my horse right
through them.  On this the cries redoubled, and the
crowd increased so fast, that I was fain to ride at a
trot towards the house of a guantero (a maker of
those gloves for which Ciudad Real is famous
throughout Spain), on whom I had been billeted.  There I
found Darby Crogan awaiting me, breathless, exasperated,
and carbine in hand, for he, too, had been
followed in the same manner by a mob, who shouted,
yelled, threw mud, stones, and rotten melons, with
every missile which the uncleaned streets so readily
afforded.  We were perfectly at a loss to comprehend
the cause of treatment so unusual and so unmerited.
</p>

<p>
"'El guantero, our patron, is as cross as two
sticks, or a bag of ould nails, devil mend him! and
unless your honour has a coin about you, it's but a
cowld supper we'll have,' said Crogan, as we entered
the sala, or principal apartment of the house.
</p>

<p>
"'I have not had a peseta since we left Mora,' said
I; 'but here is the patron at supper, on a cold fowl,
too! we are just in time.'
</p>

<p>
"'Sure he'll ask us to ate wid him&mdash;Och! for the
smallest taste in life!' sighed poor Darby, for our
food had been principally roasted castanos during
the two previous days, so miserably was the Spanish
commissariat conducted.  The patron was certainly
at supper; but, instead of welcoming us to his house
as the deliverers of Spain, who had driven the
usurper from Torres Vedras to the Douro, from the
Douro to the Ebro, and from thence towards the
Pyrenees, he barely bestowed a bow upon us, and
desired his servant to conduct me to one room and
Crogan to another.  Amazed at the coldness of this
reception within, which corresponded so exactly with
the ungenerous treatment of the mob without, a
storm of indignation gathered in my heart; but
being aware that a strong Spanish garrison occupied
the citadel, and that the Dons were lads who did not
stand on trifles, I pocketed my wrath and turned
away, resolving on the morrow to discover Donna
Emerenciana and la nina Estella.
</p>

<p>
"'Blue blazes!' grumbled Darby; 'are we not to
have a ration of something to-night?  Lord, sir, you
don't know how hungry I am, for the two insides o'
me are sticking together.  I wish we had hould of
that darling pullet.'
</p>

<p>
"'So do I, Crogan, and that the old guantero had
hold of the horns of the moon.'
</p>

<p>
"'Wid his fingers well greased, the ould thief!
Never mind, sir, wait till they're all asleep, and if I
lave a place unransacked, I am not the boy of ould
Widdy Crogan, at the four cross-roads.'
</p>

<p>
"The sulky looks of the glover were reflected by
those of his wife and servant, a buxom Basque
woman, who wore her coal-black hair plaited into one
long tail, which overhung her thick woollen petticoat
of bright yellow.  Her stockings were scarlet; and I
saw Crogan squinting at her well-turned ankles,
cased in their neat leather abarcas, as she tripped
before us, up the steep wooden stair that led to my
apartment.  The brown-cheeked Basque bade us
'good-night,' in bad Spanish, set down the light,
and on being told that one room would do for the
soldier and myself, withdrew.  Crogan placed a few
chairs against the door, and near them lay down on
the floor, with his carbine loaded and half-cocked.
Without undressing, I threw myself on the bed, with
my drawn sword beside me, for the uproar still
continued in the street; but long before its din had died
away, we were both buried in profound sleep&mdash;the
deep and dreamless slumber of long weariness and
toil.
</p>

<p>
"From this happy state I was aroused about midnight
by a loud noise.  Sword in hand, I sprang up,
and Darby's promise to overhaul the patron's pantry
flashed upon my mind.  But, lo! a lantern glared
into my eyes; and I saw the brown uniforms, red
facings, silver epaulettes, bronzed features, and
enormous mustaches of several Spanish officers, who
surrounded me with drawn swords.  Among them I
recognised Don José Gonzalez y Llano, the town-major,
by whose orders I was roughly seized and disarmed.
The lantern was held rudely before my face,
then to my belt-plate and the buttons of my coat.
</p>

<p>
"'The seventy-first regimento infanteria de Escotos,'
said one.
</p>

<p>
"'La division de Don Roland Hill,' said another.
</p>

<p>
"'Señores, what is the meaning of this intrusion,
and how dare you lay hands thus upon me?'
</p>

<p>
"'The Marquis of Santa Cruz de la Zarza will tell
you that,' said the little major, insolently.
</p>

<p>
"'Then where is the marquis?' asked I, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"'At his palace, where he waits you, and requires
your presence,' said a young officer, who wore the
cross of St. James and the splendid uniform of an
Ayudante de Campo.  'Come with us, señor,' he
added, politely.  'I beg to assure you that resistance
is worse than useless; so permit me, for the present,
to receive your sword.'
</p>

<p>
"I handed the young aide-de-camp my belt and
scabbard.
</p>

<p>
"'Gentlemen, I beg you to remember that I am
an officer bearing his Britannic Majesty's
commission.'  And without saying more, I accompanied
them from the house of the glover, under escort of
four Spanish soldiers, who surrounded me with fixed
bayonets.  In silence we traversed various streets,
which were buried in darkness and obscurity; and I
saw nothing of Crogan (for I had been seized while
he was on his exploring expedition); yet though
anxious and perplexed, I maintained a haughty
silence, and disdained to question my conductors.
</p>

<p>
"The bell of the cathedral tolled midnight as we
entered the great Plaza, and saw before us the stately
palace of the marquis brilliantly illuminated, for he
was giving a magnificent fete in honour of his patron
saint, whose festival had occurred on the day that
had passed.  From the lofty latticed windows,
four-and-twenty lines of variously-coloured light fell across
the great Plaza of the bull-fights, and shed their
prismatic hues on its plashing fountains.  A flight of
marble steps led us to the vestibule, where a Spanish
guard of honour was under arms, with fixed bayonets;
and, passing between their ranks, we ascended
to the grand saloon of the palace.
</p>

<p>
"In that magnificent apartment, decorated in the
florid and profusely-gilded style of Charles the Fifth's
time, filled with a deluge of light from crystal
chandeliers, and over a slippery floor of clear and
tesselated marble, I was led by my conductors through the
glittering crowd of guests.  On every hand I saw the
brown uniforms, red facings, and silver epaulettes of
the Spanish line, the blue and silver of the
Portuguese, the green of the Cazadores, and the black
velvet suits of old-fashioned cavaliers, wearing the
crosses of St. James and of Calatrava.  The ladies
wore, almost uniformly, dresses of black or white, but
with a profusion of the richest lace.  Many of them
looked like beautiful black-eyed brides, for their
brows were wreathed with flowers, or they had one
fresh red rose among their dark glossy hair, placed
just beside the comb, from which fell that sweeping
veil which like a gauzy mist floated about their superb
figures.  For years I had not looked on such a
scene.
</p>

<p>
"'Madre de Dios! what an officer!'  'O!  Santos! that
a British officer!'  'Morte de Dios! he a cavalier!'
were the exclamations in every varying tone.
I was led along the saloon; the music ceased in the
gilded gallery; the dancers paused, mingled, and
crowded about us; then reflecting that I had come
straight from the camp and field, where my
comrades were facing danger and death for these same
Spaniards, I thought the exhibition made of me by
the Major Don José Gonzalez, of the regiment of
Leon, alike scurvy and ungrateful.  Our division of
the army had not received a farthing of pay for six
months at that time, and many a brave fellow fell at
Vittoria and the Pyrenees without receiving his
hard-won arrears, which, more than probably, his relations
never obtained either.
</p>

<p>
"I was in the same plight in which I had marched
from Aranjuez; my wings worn to black wire; coat
purple, and patched with grey and blue at the elbows;
my Tartan trews a mass of darns; scabbard, as I
have said, six inches too short for the claymore; shoes
all gone at the toes; and my last shirt all gone too,
save the wrists and collar.  But I was weatherbeaten
as a smuggler; and I looked more like a soldier
than the pomatumed Dons of the Spanish line, or
the Cavaliers of Calatrava, who turned up their
mustaches and muttered 'basta!' as I passed them, to
where the Marquis stood, with a lady leaning on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don Christoval, of Santa Cruz, was a tall, gaunt
man, with a long Castilian visage, black lack-lustre
eyes, and a solemn air of lofty pomposity.  His
mustaches were curled up to his ears.  He had an
enormous basket-hilted toledo depending from a
sling-belt, and carried his handkerchief stuffed into
the hilt thereof.  He wore the uniform of a Spanish
lieutenant-general, and had various little gold and
silver ornaments sparkling on his breast.  I was
aware that a graceful and bright-eyed young girl, in
white lace, with her head wreathed by a superb tiara
of brilliants, leaned on his arm; but so solemnly
severe was the brow of the Marquis and so brief his
greeting, though in the old style of Castilian courtesy,
that he riveted my whole attention.  Besides, I was
not a little indignant at the unceremonious manner
in which I had been brought before him, and made
a spectacle to his guests.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor Don Christoval,' said I, 'for what am I
brought&mdash;I may say dragged&mdash;hither from my billet,
after a tedious march, and after having duly delivered
over my detachment, according to my orders from
head-quarters?'
</p>

<p>
"'Señor official,' replied the Marquis, with a look
of grave severity, 'you are charged with murdering
two Spaniards, carrying off twenty mules from La
Guardia, and levying other contributions in the
partida.'
</p>

<p>
"'Who dare to be my accusers?' I asked, thunder-struck
at such a charge.
</p>

<p>
"'The alcalde of La Guardia, whose brother is one
of the slain; and Alonzo Perez, a master-muleteer of
Fuentelfresno, whose mules you carried off.'
</p>

<p>
"'Marquis, on my honour as a British officer and
gentleman, I deny this.'
</p>

<p>
"The Marquis smiled coldly, as he replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'To-morrow we will confront you with the worthy
alcalde; and as for the mules, the owner recognised
them this morning, drawing your waggons into Ciudad
Real.  Each animal has a private notch in its ears.'
</p>

<p>
"'Marquis, I beg to assure you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Sir&mdash;no more.  Here I cannot listen to explanations.
I might place a guard over you, but nevertheless
consider yourself a prisoner, and believe that
any attempt to escape will be deemed but a proof of
guilt.  Retain your sword&mdash;partake of our hospitality;
and I hope, señor, that the morrow will find
you prepared to refute these dark charges.'
</p>

<p>
"He waved his hand with such an air as a Castilian
noble could alone assume, and with a lofty gait strode
away: then in his daughter, who swept on by his
side, for the first time I recognised the young lady
I had rescued at La Guardia, the original of the
portrait Darby had found, and which at that moment I
had upon my person.
</p>

<p>
"Her large dark eyes dilated with astonishment, and
then sparkled with the recognition, which the
punctilio of the place or her father's pride and severity,
together with my tatterdemalion aspect, prevented her
avowing; and thus, though I had saved her life&mdash;yea,
more than her life&mdash;at the risk of my own, this
dazzling creature passed away and left me, without a
word of thanks or courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"I do not remember that I felt either the alarm,
horror, or astonishment that might be supposed
consequent to an accusation so startling as murder and
marauding.  I can only account for this by the
deadness of feeling and of all sense of danger which
results from actual service and warfare.  But there was
one emotion which I felt deeply&mdash;an angry pride;
aware that I was an object of aversion and suspicion
to the gay guests of the Marquis, among whom the
fat and ferocious little town-major made himself very
conspicuous in laying down the Spanish military law
on the enormities I had committed.  The hidalgos
gazed at me indignantly through their eye-glasses;
the dark-eyed donnas peeped timidly through the
openings of their veils, and 'matador, borrachio,
Inglese ladrone,' were the gentlest of the epithets I
heard muttered by many a pretty lip.  My heart
swelled with rage, and instead of joining the dancers,
or aiding in the onslaught made upon the viands
which covered the long tables of an adjoining saloon,
between lofty epergnes and vases of crystal and
silver, filled with summer flowers, I stood aloof with
folded arms, and felt the smarting of a wound
received but a few months before&mdash;and that wound
was received for Spain, and on Spanish ground!
</p>

<p>
"At a little distance I saw the Donna Estella
whispering to her father's aide-de-camp.  A minute
afterwards he approached me.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor,' said he, 'if you will pardon the advice
of a friend, I beseech you to retire to your quarters,
for all here view you with hostile eyes; and, as a
brave soldier, to whom my little cousin owes (as she
has told me) her life, I cannot afford to see you thus
misused.  To-morrow, I hope, will see these clouds
dispelled; meantime, allow me to accompany you.
I have here a spare apartment, to which you are
welcome.'
</p>

<p>
"All places were alike to me; I accepted his offer
with gratitude; and, as we descended to the vestibule,
the first person I met was honest Darby Crogan,
with his sword under his arm, and his keen grey
Irish eyes sparkling with rage; and he pushed the
laced lacqueys right and left.
</p>

<p>
"'I have heard it all, sir,' said the brave fellow,
who had been anxious about me; 'and mighty hard
it will go wid you.  It was all the doin' of that
capthin of the Chaseers Britaneeks, who came out of
his own route into ours, ransacked La Guardia, and
carried off the mules (bad cess to them!).  They were
found with us, and the owner is ready to swear by
this and by that, and by everything else, that you
are the man, and these are his mules, as he knows
by the holes punched in their ears, and to these
holes he is as ready to swear as to his own two eyes.'
</p>

<p>
"'True, Darby; but how is all this to be explained
to these hostile and obstinate Spaniards?'
</p>

<p>
"'Kape your mind aisy, sir; there are four good
hours till daybreak yet, and if I don't astonish them
thaving Dons, I am not Darby Crogan of the 4th
Dragoon Guards.'
</p>

<p>
"On the terrace of the palace, which had anciently
been the head-quarters of that celebrated fraternity,
the Santa Hermandad, founded in 1249 for the
suppression of robbers, I walked to and fro for half an
hour with the aide-de-camp, enjoying a cigar, talking
of the war, my own mishap, and longing to ask a
few questions about his dark-eyed cousin, with whom
her miniature had made me so intimately acquainted.
The glorious moon was rolling through an unclouded
Spanish sky, pouring a flood of silver light into the
Plaza and court of the palace, on the towers of the
great church, and the magnificent hospital of
Cardinal Lorenzana, the good and wise Archbishop of
Toledo.  The gardens of the Marquis were all lighted
up by the same white radiance; the foliage of the
citron trees was edged with silver and laden with
perfume; the rose-trees hung their dewy blossoms
over the marble fountains, the clear waters of which
plashed and sparkled in the moonlight.  After a
pause, I ventured to ask&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'What is the name of the&mdash;the Marquis's daughter?'
</p>

<p>
"'My cousin&mdash;la nina&mdash;Estella de la Zarza.'
</p>

<p>
"'A pretty one enough; and she is about to change
it, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
"'Change it!' reiterated the Ayudante de Campo,
who did not perceive that I was fishing for a certain
information.  'Oh!  I see&mdash;marriage.  She is about
to marry, Corpo de Baccho!  yes, but our Spanish
ladies do not change their names when they marry.'
</p>

<p>
"'And who is the happy man&mdash;yourself, señor?'
</p>

<p>
"'Nay, nay&mdash;we Catholics cannot marry our cousins.
Next week she is to wed old Don José Gonzalez.'
</p>

<p>
"'What! that old beer-barrel, the town-major?'
</p>

<p>
"'Si, señor,' replied he, twirling his mustaches,
with a doubtful look: while I felt that I was
beginning to abhor that town-major immeasurably.
</p>

<p>
"About eight o'clock next morning I saw sixteen
Spanish officers in full uniform, with their swords
and belts, preceded by the said Don José, marching
in file through the court of the palace, at the
side-door of which they entered.  A few minutes
afterwards my friend, the aide-de-camp, came to acquaint
me, that "the court-martial, by which I was to be
tried, was constituted, and awaited me."  Without
any futile protestation against the illegality and
rapidity of this measure, I followed him to a spacious
apartment, having four large windows, which opened
clown to the floor, and overlooked a grass park which
lay behind the palace.  The members of the court,
over which the town-major (who, from the first, had
constituted himself my deadly enemy) presided, were
solemnly sworn across their swords; they promised
to administer justice according to the laws of war, and
so forth, and then the prosecution proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"I was charged with murdering, or causing to be
shot, two peasants; robbery, in levying contributions;
blasphemous sacrilege, in destroying a statue of the
Blessed Virgin.  My horizon was now black as it
could be!  I knew very little of the language.  Save
Crogan, who remained beside me in court, I had not
a friend or a comrade near me; for the whole of my
guard had marched for Belem four hours before,
while Maurice Quill, and the other sick officers, could
neither defend nor succour me.  I perceived in a
moment, that, as Crogan said, I had been accused of
outrages committed by les Chasseurs Britanniques (who
wore scarlet uniform); but I resolved, that unless
matters went hard with myself, not to criminate their
officer, who, by leaving his own proper route, and
relaxing his discipline, had become guilty of the
acts for which I was that day to suffer.  The three
principal witnesses against me were, the alcalde, the
muleteer, and a farmer from the partida of La
Guardia.
</p>

<p>
"The first&mdash;old, stupid, half-blind, and obstinate&mdash;swore
to my face that I was the officer who had
ordered his dear brother Vincentio, the abogado, to be
shot on his own threshold, and another man to be
bayoneted.  In vain I drew his attention to the Highland
cap of the 71st, and to my tartan trews, assuring
him that I was an Escoto.  He shook his head&mdash;I
wore a red coat&mdash;I was the very man!
</p>

<p>
"Then came the muleteer, a sturdy Catalonian, clad
in a fur jacket and yellow cotton breeches, wearing a
broad sombrero, under which his black hair hung in
a red net.  He, too, swore across his knife, that I had
carried off his train of mules, or at least, that at the
bayonet's point, my soldiers had done so, to travel
more at their ease.
</p>

<p>
"'He did not see me, neither did he then see any
waggons of sick, but he knew his mules as well as if
he had been the father of them, the moment they
appeared in the streets of la Ciudad Real.'
</p>

<p>
"'You will swear to your mules, hombre?'
</p>

<p>
"'By the marks in their ears, Don José, as readily
as I would swear to my own nose.'
</p>

<p>
"'Lead forward some of those mules to the window,
and let the witness see them.'
</p>

<p>
"An uproar of voices was heard in the park, and the
witness, who went to the window, uttered a cry of
dismay.  The ears of his twenty mules had been
shred off close by the bone!
</p>

<p>
"'Morte de Dios!' growled the officers, twirling
their mustaches; 'these Inglesos are devils!'
</p>

<p>
"'It was murtherin cruel for the poor bastes,'
whispered Darby Crogan; 'but it was all to save your
honour's life I cropped them; and sure it is worth a
bushel of mules' ears; for it was a good bushel ov
'em I buried this blessed morning.  The Lord reward
Misther Quill, for it was his best docthor's knife he
lint me, to make croppies of them all.'
</p>

<p>
"The little Major Don José was bursting with wrath.
</p>

<p>
"'Call the next witness,' he exclaimed, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"A tall, powerfully-formed, and fair-complexioned
man, who, contrary to the Spanish custom, was closely
shaven, now came forward, and stated himself to be a
farmer, or jardinero, at Mora and La Guardia.  He
had a large patch on his cheek, and kept one hand
constantly thrust into the red and yellow sash which
girt his waist.
</p>

<p>
"Confronting me boldly and vindictively, with all
the glare of hate a cold grey eye can pour, he accused
me of destroying for firewood a statue of the Virgin
at Mora, and swore to having seen the act committed.
A growl of anger followed his evidence; and I found
that shooting an alcalde's brother, and carrying off
twenty mules, were mere jokes, compared to this.  I
was startled by his voice, which, assuredly, I had
heard before&mdash;but where?  What could be the origin
of a charge so false, so strange, as sacrilege?  I
turned to question him, but he was at that moment
ordered to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
"'Señor Ayudante de Campo,' said Don José,
'read from the RECOPILACION of the military
penalties the first article.'
</p>

<p>
"'El que blasfamare el santo nombre de Dios, de la
Vergén ó de los Santos, será immediamente preso y
castigado por la primero vez con la,' &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
"'Read the fourth article, concerning outrage to
divine images, for the prisoner has been alike
sacrilegious and blasphemous.'
</p>

<p>
"'El que con irreverencia y deliberation cannocida
de desprecio ajare de obra las sagradas imagenes,
ornamentos ó cualquierro de las casas dedicados al
Divino culto, ó las hurtare, servá ahorcado,' &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
"'The plot thickens,' thought I.
</p>

<p>
"In short, they sentenced me to be hanged.
</p>

<p>
"The Marquis, as Governor of Ciudad Heal, dared
to confirm this unjust sentence, which he directed
should be put in execution in the Plaza, at eight
o'clock on the following morning.
</p>

<p>
"Far, far from aid and my comrades; wholly at the
mercy of men, whose hearts the cunning charge of
the last witness had totally closed against me; aware
of the futility of denial and defiance, and the
hopelessness of rescue or escape, I sat in a grated room
of the public carcel, or gaol, of the town, almost
stupefied by the suddenness, the shame, and
opprobrium of my impending fate.  'Poets and painters,'
says a certain writer, 'have ever made the estate of a
man condemned to die one of their favourite themes
of comment or description.'  By heavens!  I never
met one of either which came within a thousand
degrees of the agony I endured that night at Ciudad
Real.  I, a gentleman, a soldier, bearing on my
person three wounds, won on that accursed Spanish
soil; innocent of all they alleged; young, with a long
life and rapid promotion before me, to be cut off
thus&mdash;strangled like a garotted villain&mdash;hanged like a
dog, to glut the noonday frenzy of a Spanish rabble!
Horrible!  I had often faced death without shrinking;
but now, like a coward's, my whole soul shrunk from
such a death as that which these Spaniards meted
out to me.
</p>

<p>
"The night came on: I sat in darkness, revolving a
myriad futile plans of escape.  I was to die to-morrow,
and that conviction seemed palpably before me.  I
heard it, saw it, felt it; there was a dull sound
humming in my ears&mdash;a tingling in my heart.  I
recollected, with remorse and shame, how coldly, calmly,
and unmoved I had seen the provost-marshal's guard
hang six soldiers on the retreat from Burgos.  I
remembered their struggles, their agonies, and
wondered how they felt.  I passed a hand over my throat,
compressed it a little, and shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"And now, in the man who had accused me of
sacrilege, I suddenly remembered Barba Roxa, the
robber, and the hand I had maimed was that which
he retained in his sash.
</p>

<p>
"'Fool! fool! that I am,' I exclaimed, bitterly;
'where were my eyes, my ears, my faculties, that
knew him not before?  This is his revenge&mdash;his
Spaniard's triumph.'
</p>

<p>
"Even my friend, the aide-de-camp, seemed to have
abandoned me; and could it be that the pretty
daughter of the Marquis had not pleaded, or said one
kind word to save the poor officer who had so freely
risked his life for hers?
</p>

<p>
"All at once my stupor left me.  I sprang to the
bars of the window, and from their solid sockets,
madly strove to wrench them with a tiger's strength.
I felt every corner; the vast iron lock of the door,
the door itself moveless as a wall of adamant.  Vain,
vain!  I was to die to-morrow, and my swollen heart
almost burst with emotion, when I thought of my
friends, my family, and my regiment, all canvassing
the various causes of a death so ignominious.
</p>

<p>
"A face appeared suddenly at the window, which
was raised.
</p>

<p>
"'Don't be alarmed, yer honour, it's only me,'
said a voice.
</p>

<p>
"'Crogan&mdash;you!' I exclaimed, in the confusion of
my thoughts; 'are you not dead&mdash;in heaven?'
</p>

<p>
"'In heaven&mdash;the Lord forbid!  I'm here, standing
on my two feet, not that I think people there stand
on their heads; but don't be spakin' in that doleful
way, sir, at all, for you must prepare to lave this place
in less than no time.  Do you hear the knockin' of
hammers?  It's them thavin' Spaniards puttin' up
the dancin' post in the Plaza&mdash;blazes take that
same!'
</p>

<p>
"'Leave this!  Crogan; but how?'
</p>

<p>
"'By the door, to be sure.  It will be opened in
ten minutes; and horses are waitin' for the three of
us, I hope, at the corner of the sthreet.'
</p>

<p>
"'The three of us, Darby?'
</p>

<p>
"'Ay, sir, just the three of us; for isn't there a
darlin' young lady goin', too?&mdash;but I must be afther
lookin' to the girths and straps of our cattle.'
</p>

<p>
"He was scarcely gone when the door of the room
opened, and the daughter of the Marquis stood
before me, together with a man bearing a light; and in
that man I recognised the under carcelero, or turnkey.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh! señora,' I exclaimed, my heart bounding
with gratitude and joy, 'you have not forgotten
me&mdash;or abandoned me to this cruel and unmerited death.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hush, señor; not a word of thanks or of transport,
for that would spoil all,' she replied, with
calmness and decision.  'I do, indeed, owe you a
debt of gratitude; but the mention of that to my
father, and more than all to Don José&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, you shudder at that name.'
</p>

<p>
"'Would but accelerate your fate.  I have bribed
the carcelero,' she whispered, 'and he will sleep
sound.  His deputy is about to join the guerillas of
the great Don Julian Sanchez, and for twenty dollars
will guide you to Madrid, sent by my cousin, the
ayudante; your horses are waiting at the corner of
the Plaza.  No more,' she added, shortly, when I
attempted to kiss her hand, which the thick folds of
her ample veil concealed.
</p>

<p>
"In a minute we had left the detested prison-house,
and crossed the garden which lay between it and the
Plaza.  Again the glorious moon was rolling in its
silver splendour over Ciudad Heal; and as I gazed
on my fair companion, the interest I felt for her
returned vividly, and became stronger, as the moment
approached when I should leave her for ever.  I saw
her magnificent eyes sparkling through her veil.
</p>

<p>
"'Señora,' said I, with hesitation, as our attendant,
by hurrying on before, had left us for one instant
alone&mdash;'Señora,' I continued, urged by a kind, a
grateful, and a stronger impulse than I could at that
time analyse, 'though to remain here is remaining
but to die, I leave Ciudad Real with the most sincere
sorrow.'
</p>

<p>
"'And why?'
</p>

<p>
"'Because I may never see you again.'
</p>

<p>
"'But I also am going to Madrid&mdash;and this night, too.'
</p>

<p>
"I remembered the words of Crogan; I knew alia
Spanish love was capable of; my heart leaped within me.
</p>

<p>
"'Madrid!' I reiterated.
</p>

<p>
"'With you and your brave dragoon.  Ah, señor,
do not refuse to escort me.  My father is bent on
marrying me to Don José&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'What!&mdash;that rascally old town-major?  My dear
señora, I beg you not to think of it.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah!  I have thought a great deal of it, and wept
for it too.'
</p>

<p>
"'Then,' said I, drawing my breath more freely,
end seeing a prospect of vengeance on the
pot-bellied major, 'you do not love him?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh no; I hate, abhor, detest him; and to avoid
him, am about to retire to Madrid, where my aunt
lives.  She is reverend mother at our Lady of Attocha.
You know the great convent where the little Jesus is
that works the miracles, and looks so beautiful, a
love of an infant, on the altar of the Hundred Lamps.
My aunt will save me from this detested union if you,
señor, will but afford me your escort.  I am friendless,'
she continued, weeping; 'for such is the terror of
my father's name that there is not a man in Ciudad
Real whom I can trust.  Yet I shall confide in your
goodness; indeed I am sure&mdash;I know&mdash;I think, I
may.  The British officer has a high sense of chivalry
'and honour, but Ay de mi! el Espanol no tiene
nada.'
</p>

<p>
"'Madam,' said I, touched to the heart by the
compliment, and her confiding nature, 'trust to me,
and while life remains, by heaven, and that honour,
I will see you safely to Madrid.'
</p>

<p>
"Crogan, with three saddle-horses, stood at the gate.
We mounted, the fair Estella springing on her jennet,
à la cavalier, in the fashion of Old Castile.  We left
Ciudad Heal by the northern gate, and then put our
horses to their mettle, as we avoided the direct route
to Madrid, and struck off into the mountains towards
Carrion de Calatrava.
</p>

<p>
"I might spin my story beyond the limits allotted to
me, but surely it requires no conjuror to guess the
sequel!  The interest begun by the miniature, so
fortunately found, the charming society, confidence,
and generous spirit of the original strengthened and
confirmed.  In four days we reached Madrid, in four
more we were married in the convent chapel of
Attocha.
</p>

<p>
"The Marquis sent the Major Don José expressly
to Wellington, requesting him to hang and behead
me.  His grace declined to accede, but the name of
Captain &mdash;&mdash;, of Les Chasseurs Britanniques, was
struck out of the army-list.  My head is still safe on
my shoulders, though somewhat powdered by time.
Thanks to his Grace of Richmond, I have got my
medal with eight clasps, and La Señora Estella (now
known by another name) is, though somewhat old like
myself, one of the dearest and most affectionate wives
in the world, and I crave a bumper in her honour,
gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
Such was the story of our worthy major, whose
toast I need scarcely say was drunk with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Our doctor was the next, and like every one who
has a story to tell he had listened with considerable
impatience to the adventures of the major, and the
moment his toast had been duly honoured and
silence was restored, he began his tale without further
preface, and was then followed by our rough old
Highland quartermaster.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
A LEGEND OF FIFE.
</h3>

<p>
I can only give you an old Scottish story of the last
century, with the incidents of which I became
familiar in my student days when attending the ancient
university of St. Andrew's, where I worked my
way manfully through the classes of chemistry,
anatomy, and natural philosophy; and felt as proud of
my academic gown as I have done in later years of
my red coat and epaulettes, and perhaps as happy,
too, for some of the most joyous days, and certainly
the most uproarious nights of my past life, have been
spent in the auld East Neuk of Fife&mdash;God bless it!
</p>

<p>
And now for my legend.
</p>

<p>
It was a cold night in the March of the year 1708.
The hour of ten had tolled from the old Gothic
collegiate church; beating on his drum, the
drummer in the livery of the burgh had proceeded from
the Market-cross to the ruins of St. David's Castle,
and from thence to the chapel of St. Rufus, and
having made one long roll or flourish at the point
from whence his peregrination began, he adjourned
to the "Thane of Fife" to procure a dram, while the
good folks of Crail composed themselves for the
night, and the barring of doors and windows
announced that those who were within had resolved to
make themselves comfortable and secure, while those
unfortunate wights that were without were likely to
remain so.
</p>

<p>
Hollowly the German Sea was booming on the
rocks of the harbour; and from its hazy surface a
cold east wind swept over the flat, bleak coast of
Crail; a star peeped at times between the flying
clouds, and even the moon looked forth once, but
immediately veiled her face again, as if one glance
at the iron shore and barren scenery, unenlivened by
hedge or tree, were quite enough to prevent her from
looking again.
</p>

<p>
The town-drummer had received his dram and
withdrawn, and Master Spiggot, the gudeman or
landlord of the Thane of Fife, the principal tavern,
and only inn or hostel in the burgh, was taking a
last view of the main street, and considering the
propriety of closing for the night.  It was broad,
spacious, and is still overlooked by many a tall and
gable-ended mansion, whose antique and massive
aspect announces that, like other Fifeshire burghs
before the Union in the preceding year, it had seen
better days.  Indeed, the house then occupied by
Master Spiggot himself, and from which his sign
bearing the panoplied Thane at full gallop on a
caparisoned steed, swung creaking in the night wind,
was one of those ancient edifices, and in former days
had belonged to the provost of the adjoining kirk:
but this was (as Spiggot said), "in the auld-warld times
o' the Papistrie."
</p>

<p>
The gudeman shook his white head solemnly and
sadly, as he looked down the empty thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
"There was a time," he muttered, and paused.
</p>

<p>
Silent and desolate as any in the ruins of Thebes,
the street was half covered with weeds and rank
grass that grew between the stones, and Spiggot
could see them waving in the dim starlight.
</p>

<p>
Crail is an out-of-the-way place.  It is without
thoroughfare and without trade; few leave it and still
fewer think of going there, for there one feels as if
on the very verge of society; for even by day, there
reigns a monastic gloom, a desertion, a melancholy,
a uniform and voiceless silence, broken only by the
croak of the gleds and the cawing of the clamorous
gulls nestling on the old church tower, while the sea
booms incessantly as it rolls on the rocky beach.
</p>

<p>
But there was a time when it was otherwise; when
the hum of commerce rose around its sculptured
cross, and there was a daily bustle in the chambers
of its Town-hall, for there a portly provost and bailies
with a battalion of seventeen corpulent councillors
sat solemnly deliberating on the affairs of the burgh,
and swelling with a municipal importance that was
felt throughout the whole East Neuk of Fife; for, in
those days, the bearded Russ and red-haired Dane,
the Norwayer and the Hollander, laden with
merchandise, furled their sails in that deserted harbour
where now scarcely a fisherboat is seen; for on
Crail, as on all its sister towns along the coast, fell
surely and heavily that decay of trade which
succeeded the Union in 1707.
</p>

<p>
On the sad changes a year had brought about,
Spiggot pondered sadly, and was only roused from
his dreamy mood by the sudden apparition of a
traveller on horseback standing before him; for so long
and so soft was the grass of the street that his
approach had been unheard by the dreamer, whose
mind was wandering after the departed glories of the
East Neuk.
</p>

<p>
"A cold night, landlord, for such I take you to
be," said the stranger, in a bold and cheerful voice,
as he dismounted.
</p>

<p>
"A cauld night and a dreary too," sighed poor
Boniface, as he bowed, and hastened to seize the
stranger's bridle, and buckled it to a ring at tha
door-cheek; "but the sicht of a visitor does gude to
my heart; step in, sir.  A warm posset that was
simmering in the parlour for myself is at your service,
and I'll set the stall-boy to corn your beast and
stable it."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, gudeman; but for unharnessing it
matters not, as I must ride onward; but I will take
the posset with thanks, for I am chilled to death by
my long ride along this misty coast."
</p>

<p>
Spiggot looked intently at the traveller as he
stooped, and entering the low-arched door which
was surmounted by an old monastic legend, trod
into the bar with a heavy clanking stride, for he was
accoutred with jack boots and gilded spurs.  His
rocquelaure was of scarlet cloth, warmly furred, and
the long curls of his Ramilies wig flowed over it.
His beaver was looped upon three sides with
something of a military air, and one long white feather
that adorned it, floated down his back, for the dew
was heavy on it.  He was a handsome man, about
forty years of age, well sunburned, with a keen dark
eye, and close-clipped moustache, which indicated
that he had served in foreign wars.  He threw his
hat and long jewelled rapier aside, and on removing
his rocquelaure, discovered a white velvet coat more
richly covered with lace than any that Spiggot had
seen even in the palmiest days of Crail.
</p>

<p>
According to the fashion of Queen Anne's courtiers,
it was without a collar, to display the long
white cravat of point d'Espagne, without cuffs, and
edged from top to bottom with broad bars of lace,
clasps and buttons of silver the whole length; being
compressed at the waist by a very ornamental belt,
fastened by a large gold buckle.
</p>

<p>
"Your honour canna think of riding on to-night,"
urged Boniface; "and if a Crail-capon done just to
perfection, and a stoup of the best wine, at least,
siccan wine as we get by the east seas, since that
vile incorporating Union&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Vile and damnable! say I," interrupted the
stranger.
</p>

<p>
"True for ye, sir," said Spiggot, with a kindling
eye; "but if these puir viands can induce ye to partake
of the hospitality of my puir hostel, that like our
gude burrowtoun is no just what it has been&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gudeman, 'tis impossible, for I must ride so
soon as I have imbibed thy posset."
</p>

<p>
"As ye please, sir&mdash;your honour's will be done.
Our guests are now, even as the visits of angels,
unco few and far between; and thus, when one
comes, we are loath to part with him.  There is a
deep pitfall, and an ugly gulleyhole where the burn
crosses the road at the town-head, and if ye miss
the path, the rocks by the beach are steep, and in a
night like this&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Host of mine," laughed the traveller, "I know
right well every rood of the way, and by keeping to
the left near the Auldlees may avoid both the blackpit
and the sea-beach."
</p>

<p>
"Your honour kens the country hereawa, then?"
said Spiggot with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Of old, perhaps, I knew it as well as thee."
</p>

<p>
The gudeman of the Thane scrutinised the traveller's
face keenly, but failed to recognise him, and
until this moment, he thought that no man in the
East Neuk was unknown to him; but here his
inspection was at fault.
</p>

<p>
"And hast thou no visitors with thee now, friend
host?" he asked of Spiggot.
</p>

<p>
"One only, gude sir, who came here on a brown
horse about nightfall.  He is an unco' foreign-looking
man, but has been asking the way to the castle
o' Balcomie."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! and thou didst tell of this plaguey pitfall, I
warrant."
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly, your honour, in kindness I did but
hint of it."
</p>

<p>
"And thereupon he stayed.  Balcomie&mdash;indeed! and
what manner of man is he?"
</p>

<p>
"By the corslet which he wears under his coat,
and the jaunty cock of his beaver, I would say he
had been a soldier."
</p>

<p>
"Good again&mdash;give him my most humble commendations,
and ask him to share thy boasted posset
of wine with me."
</p>

<p>
"What name did you say, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Thou inquisitive varlet, I said no name," replied
the gentleman, with a smile.  "In these times men
do not lightly give their names to each other, when
the land is swarming with Jacobite plotters and
government spies, disguised Jesuits, and Presbyterian
tyrants.  I may be the Devil or the Pope, for
all thou knowest."
</p>

<p>
"Might ye no be the Pretender?" said Spiggot,
with a sour smile.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I have a better travelling name than that;
but say to this gentleman that the Major of Marshal
Orkney's Dragoons requests the pleasure of sharing
a stoup of wine with him."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, it mattereth little whether you give your
name or no," replied the host bitterly; "for we are
a' nameless now.  Twelve months ago, we were true
Scottish men, but now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Our king is an exile&mdash;our crown is buried for
ever, and our brave soldiers are banished to far and
foreign wars, while the grass is growing green in the
streets of our capital&mdash;ay, green as it is at this hour
in your burgh of Crail; but, hence to the stranger;
yet say not," added the traveller, bitterly and proudly,
"that in his warmth the Scottish cavalier has
betrayed himself."
</p>

<p>
While the speaker amused himself with examining
a printed proclamation concerning the "Tiend
Commissioners and Transplantation off Paroch Kirkis,"
which was pasted over the stone mantlepiece of the
bar, the landlord returned with the foreign
gentleman's thanks, and an invitation to his chamber,
whither the Major immediately repaired; following
the host up a narrow stone spiral stair to a
snugly-wainscotted room, against the well-grated windows
of which a sudden shower was now beginning to
patter.
</p>

<p>
The foreigner, who was supping on a Crail-capon
(in other words a broiled haddock) and stoup of
Bourdeaux wine, arose at their entrance, and bowed
with an air that was undisguisedly continental.  He
was a man above six feet, with a long straight nose,
over which his dark eyebrows met and formed one
unbroken line.  He wore a suit of green Genoese
velvet, so richly laced that little of the cloth was
visible; a full-bottomed wig, and a small corslet of
the brightest steel (over which hung the ends of his
cravat), as well as a pair of silver-mounted cavalry
pistols that lay on the table, together with his
unmistakable bearing, decided the Major of Orkney's
that the stranger was a brother of the sword.
</p>

<p>
"Fair sir, little introduction is necessary between
us, as, I believe, we have both followed the drum in
our time," said the Major, shaking the curls of his
Ramilies wig with the air of a man who has decided
on what he says.
</p>

<p>
"I have served, Monsieur," replied the foreigner,
"under Marlborough and Eugene."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! in French Flanders?  Landlord&mdash;gudeman,
harkee; a double stoup of this wine; I have found
a comrade to-night&mdash;be quick and put my horse to
stall, I will not ride hence for an hour or so.  What
regiment, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I was first under Grouvestein in the Horse of
Driesberg."
</p>

<p>
"Then you were on the left of the second column
at Ramilies&mdash;on that glorious 12th of May," said the
Major, drawing the high-backed chair which the host
handed him, and spreading out his legs before the
fire, which burned merrily in the basket grate on the
hearth, "and latterly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Under Wandenberg."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! an old tyrannical dog."
</p>

<p>
A dark cloud gathered on the stranger's lofty
brow.
</p>

<p>
"I belonged to the Earl of Orkney's Grey
Dragoons," said the Major; "and remember old
Wandenberg making a bold charge in that brilliant
onfall when we passed the lines of Monsieur le
Mareschal Villars at Pont-a-Vendin, and pushed on to the
plains of Lens."
</p>

<p>
"That was before we invested Doway and Fort-Escharpe,
where old Albergotti so ably commanded
ten thousand well-beaten soldiers."
</p>

<p>
"And then Villars drew off from his position at
sunset and encamped on the plain before Arras."
</p>

<p>
"Thou forgettest, comrade, that previously he took
up a position in rear of Escharpe."
</p>

<p>
"True; but now I am right into the very melée
of those old affairs, and the mind carries one on like
a rocket.  Your health, sir&mdash;by the way, I am still
ignorant of your name."
</p>

<p>
"I have such very particular reasons for concealing
it in this neighbourhood, that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not think me inquisitive; in these times men
should not pry too closely."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur will pardon me, I hope."
</p>

<p>
"No apology is necessary, save from myself, for
now my curiosity is thoroughly and most impertinently
whetted, to find a Frenchman in this part of
the world, here in this out-o'-the-way place, where
no one comes to, and no one goes from, on a bleak
promontory of the German Sea, the East Neuk of
Fife."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur will again excuse me; but I have most
particular business with a gentleman in this
neighbourhood; and having travelled all the way from
Paris, expressly to have it settled, I beg that I may be
excused the pain of prevarication.  The circumstance
of my having served under the great Duke of Marlborough
against my own king and countrymen is sufficiently
explained when I acquaint you, that I was
then a French Protestant refugee; but now, without
changing my religion, I have King Louis' gracious
pardon and kind protection extended to me."
</p>

<p>
"And so you were with Wandenberg when his
troopers made that daring onfall at Pont-a-Vendin,
and drove back the horse picquets of Villars," said
the Major, to lead the conversation from a point
which evidently seemed unpleasant to the stranger.
"'T was sharp, short, and decisive, as all cavalry
affairs should be.  You will of course remember that
unpleasant affair of Wandenberg's troopers who were
accused of permitting a French prisoner to escape.
It caused a great excitement in the British camp,
where some condemned the dragoons, others Van
Wandenberg, and not a few our great Marlborough
himself."
</p>

<p>
"I did hear something of it," said the stranger in
a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"The prisoner whose escape was permitted was, I
believe, the father of the youths who captured him, a
circumstance which might at least have won them
mercy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"From the Baron!"
</p>

<p>
"I forgot me; he was indeed merciless."
</p>

<p>
"But as I left his dragoons, and indeed the army
about that time, I shall be glad to hear your account
of the affair."
</p>

<p>
"It is a very unpleasant story; the more so as I
was somewhat concerned in it myself," said the Major,
slowly filling his long-stemmed glass, and watching
the white worm in its stalk, so intently as he recalled
all the circumstances he was about to relate, that he
did not observe the face of the French gentleman,
which was pale as death; and after a short pause, he
began as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In the onfall at Pont-a-Vendin, it happened that
two young Frenchmen who served as gentlemen
volunteers with you in the dragoon regiment of Van
Wandenberg, had permitted&mdash;how, or why, I pretend
not to say&mdash;the escape of a certain prisoner of
distinction.  Some said he was no other than M. le
Mareschal Villars himself.  They claimed a court-martial,
but the old baron, who was a savage-hearted
Dutchman, insisted that they should be given up
unconditionally to his own mercy, and in an evil
moment of heedlessness or haste, Marlborough consented,
and sent me (I was his aide-de-camp) with a written
order to that effect, addressed to Colonel the Baron
Van Wandenberg, whose regiment of horse I met
'en route' for St. Venant, about nightfall on a cold
and snowy evening in the month of November.
</p>

<p>
"Snow covered the whole country, which was all a
dead level, and a cold, leaden-coloured sky met the
white horizon in one unbroken line, save where the
leafless poplars of some far-off village stood up, the
landmarks of the plain.  In broad flakes the snow fell
fast, and directing their march by a distant spire, the
Dutch troopers rode slowly over the deepening fields.
They were all muffled in dark blue cloaks, on the
capes of which the snow was freezing, while the breath
of the men and horses curled like steam in the
thickening and darkening air.
</p>

<p>
"Muffled to the nose in a well-furred rocquelaure,
with my wig tied to keep the snow from its curls, and
my hat flapped over my face, I rode as fast as the deep
snow would permit, and passing the rear of the
column where, moody and disarmed, the two poor
French volunteers were riding under care of an escort
I spurred to the baron who rode in front near the
kettle drums, and delivered my order; as I did so,
recalling with sadness the anxious and wistful glance
given me by the prisoners as I passed them.
</p>

<p>
"Wandenberg, who had no more shape than a huge
hogshead, received the dispatch with a growl of
satisfaction.  He would have bowed, but his neck was too
short.  I cannot but laugh when I remember his
strange aspect.  In form he looked nearly as broad
as he was long, being nearly eight feet in girth, and
completely enveloped in a rough blue rocquelaure,
which imparted to his figure the roundness of a ball.
His face, reddened by skiedam and the frost, was
glowing like crimson, while the broad beaver hat that
overshadowed it, and the feathers with which the
beaver was edged, were encrusted with the snow that
was rapidly forming a pyramid on its crown, imparting
to his whole aspect a drollery at which I could
have laughed heartily, had not his well-known acuteness
and ferocity awed me into a becoming gravity of
demeanour; and delivering my dispatch with a tolerably
good grace, I reined back my horse to await any
reply he might be pleased to send the Duke.
</p>

<p>
"His dull Dutch eyes glared with sudden anger
and triumph, as he folded the document, and
surveyed the manacled prisoners.  Thereafter he seized
his speaking trumpet, and thundered out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Ruyters&mdash;halt! form open column of troops, trot!'
</p>

<p>
"It was done as rapidly as heavily-armed Dutchmen
on fat slow horses knee deep among snow could
perform it, and then wheeling them into line, he gave
the orders&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Forward the flanks, form circle, sling
musquetoons! trumpeters ride to the centre and dismount.'
</p>

<p>
"By these unexpected manoeuvres, I suddenly found
myself inclosed in a hollow circle of the Dutch
horsemen, and thus, as it were, compelled to become a
spectator of the scene that ensued, though I had his
Grace of Marlborough's urgent orders to rejoin him
without delay on the road to Aire."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;and you saw&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Such a specimen of discipline as neither the devil
nor De Martinet ever dreamed of; but thoroughly
Dutch, I warrant you.
</p>

<p>
"I have said it was intensely cold, and that the
night was closing; but the whiteness of the snow
that covered the vast plain, with the broad red circle
of the half-obscured moon that glimmered through
the fast-falling flakes, as it rose behind a distant spire,
cast a dim light upon the place where the Dutchmen
halted.  But deeming that insufficient, Van
Wandenberg ordered half-a-dozen torches to be lighted, for
his troopers always had such things with them, being
useful by night for various purposes; and hissing and
sputtering in the falling snow flakes, their lurid and
fitful glare was thrown on the close array of the
Dutch dragoons, on their great cumbrous hats, on the
steeple crowns of which, I have said, the snow was
gathering in cones, and the pale features of the two
prisoners, altogether imparting a wild, unearthly, and
terrible effect to the scene about to be enacted on
that wide and desolate moor.
</p>

<p>
"By order of Van Wandenberg, three halberts
were fixed into the frozen earth, with their points
bound together by a thong, after which the
dismounted trumpeters layed hands on one of the
young Frenchmen, whom they proceeded to strip of
his coat and vest.
</p>

<p>
"Disarmed and surrounded, aware of the utter
futility of resistance, the unfortunate volunteer
offered none, but gazed wistfully and imploringly at
me, and sure I am, that in my lowering brow and
kindling eyes, he must have seen the storm that was
gathering in my heart.
</p>

<p>
"'Dieu vous bénisse, Officier,' cried the Frenchman
in a mournful voice, while shuddering with cold
and horror as he was stripped to his shirt; 'save me
from this foul disgrace, and my prayers&mdash;yea, my
life&mdash;shall be for ever at your disposal.'
</p>

<p>
"'Good comrade,' said I, 'entreat me not, for here
I am powerless.'
</p>

<p>
"'Baron,' he exclaimed; 'I am a gentleman&mdash;a
gentleman of old France, and I dare thee to lay thy
damnable scourge upon me.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ach Gott; dare&mdash;do you say dare? ve vill zee,'
laughed Van Wandenberg, as the prisoner was dragged
forward and about to be forcibly trussed to the
halberts by the trumpeters, when, animated to the very
verge of insanity, he suddenly freed himself, and
rushing like a madman upon the Baron, struck him
from his horse by one blow of his clenched hand.
The horse snorted, the Dutch troopers opened their
saucer eyes wider still, as the great and corpulent
mass fell heavily among the deepening snow, and in
an instant the foot of the Frenchman was pressed
upon his throat, while he exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'If I slay thee, thou hireling dog, as I have often
slain thy clodpated countryman in other days,' and
the Frenchman laughed fiercely, 'by St. Denis!  I
shall have one foeman less on this side of Hell.'
</p>

<p>
"'Gott in Himmel! ach! mein tuyvel! mein
Gott!' gasped the Dutchman, as he floundered
beneath the heel of the vengeful and infuriated
Frenchman, who was determined on destroying him, till a
blow from the baton of an officer stretched him
almost senseless among the snow, where he was
immediately grasped by the trumpeters, disrobed of his
last remaining garment, and bound strongly to the
halberts.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile the other prisoner had been pinioned
and resolutely held by his escort, otherwise he would
undoubtedly have fallen also upon Van Wandenberg,
who, choking with a tempest of passion that was too
great to find utterance in words, had gathered up his
rotund figure, and with an agility wonderful in a man
of his years and vast obesity, so heavily armed, in a
buff coat and jack boots ribbed with iron, a heavy
sword and cloak, clambered on the back of his horse,
as a clown would climb up a wall: and with a visage
alternating between purple and blue, by the effects
of rage and strangulation, he surveyed the prisoner
for a moment in silence, and there gleamed in his
piggish grey eyes an expression of fury and pain,
bitterness and triumph combined, and he was only
able to articulate one word&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Flog!'
</p>

<p>
"On the handsome young Frenchman's dark curly
hair, glistening with the whitening snow that fell
upon it, and on his tender skin reddening in the
frosty atmosphere, on the swelling muscles of his
athletic form, on a half healed sabre-wound, and on
the lineaments of a face that then expressed the
extremity of mental agony, fell full the wavering light
of the uplifted torches.  The Dutch, accustomed to
every species of extra-judicial cruelty by sea and land,
looked on with the most grave stolidity and apathetic
indifference; while I felt an astonishment and indignation
that rapidly gave place to undisguised horror.
</p>

<p>
"'Flog!'
</p>

<p>
"The other prisoner uttered a groan that seemed
to come from his very heart, and then covered his
ears and eyes with his hands.  Wielded by a muscular
trumpeter, an immense scourge of many-knotted
cords was brought down with one fell sweep on the
white back of the victim, and nine livid bars, each
red, as if seared by a hot iron, rose under the
infliction, and again the terrible instrument was reared
by the trumpeter at the full stretch of his sinewy
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur will be aware, that until the late
Revolution of 1688, this kind of punishment was
unknown here and elsewhere, save in Holland; and
though I have seen soldiers run the gauntlet, ride
the mare, and beaten by the martinets, I shall never
oh, no! never forget the sensation of horror with
which this (to me) new punishment of the poor
Frenchman inspired me; and, sure I am, that our
great Duke of Marlborough could in no way have
anticipated it.
</p>

<p>
"Accustomed, as I have said, to every kind of cruel
severity, unmoved and stoically the Dutch looked on,
with their grey, lacklustre eyes, dull, unmeaning, and
passionless in their stolidity, contrasting strongly
with the expression of startled horror depicted in
the strained eyeballs and bent brows of the victim's
brother, when after a time he dared to look on this
revolting punishment.  Save an ill-repressed sob, or
half-muttered interjection from the suffering man, no
other sound broke the stillness of the place, where
a thousand horsemen stood in close order, but the
sputtering of the torches in the red light of which
our breaths were ascending like steam.  Yes! there
was one other sound, and it was a horrible one&mdash;the
monotonous whiz of the scourge, as it cut the keen
frosty air and descended on the lacerated back of the
fainting prisoner.  Sir, I see that my story disturbs
you.
</p>

<p>
"A corpulent Provost Mareschal, with a pair of
enormous moustaches, amid which the mouth of his
meerschaum was inserted, stood by, smoking with
admirable coolness, and marking the time with his
cane, while a drummer tapped on his kettledrum,
and four trumpeters had, each in succession, given
their twenty-five lashes and withdrawn; twice had
the knotted scourge been coagulated with blood, and
twice had it been washed in the snow which now rose
high around the feet of our champing and impatient
horses; and now the fifth torturer approached, but
still the compressed lips and clammy tongue of the
proud Frenchman refused to implore mercy.  His
head was bowed down on his breast, his body hung
pendant from the cords that encircled his swollen
and livid wrists; his back from neck to waist was one
mass of lacerated flesh, on which the feathery
snowflakes were melting; for the agony he endured must
have been like unto a stream of molten lead pouring
over him; but no groan, no entreaty escaped him,
and still the barbarous punishment proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"I have remarked that there is no event too horrible
or too sad to be without a little of the ridiculous
in it, and this was discernible here.
</p>

<p>
"One trumpeter, who appeared to have more
humanity, or perhaps less skill than his predecessors,
and did not exert himself sufficiently, was soundly
beaten by the rattan of the trumpet-major, while the
latter was castigated by the Provost Mareschal, who,
in turn for remissness of duty, received sundry blows
from the speaking-trumpet of the Baron; so they
were all laying soundly on each other for a time."
</p>

<p>
"Morbleu!" said the Frenchman, with a grim
smile, "'t was quite in the Dutch taste, that."
</p>

<p>
"The Provost Mareschal continued to mark the
time with the listless apathy of an automaton; the
smoke curled from his meerschaum, the drum continued
to tap-tap-tap, until it seemed to sound like
thunder to my strained ears, for every sense was
painfully excited.  All count had long been lost, but
when several hundred lashes had been given, Van
Wandenberg and half his Dutchmen were asleep in
their saddles.
</p>

<p>
"It was now snowing thick and fast, but still this
hideous dream continued, and still the scourging
went on.
</p>

<p>
"At last the altered sound of the lash and the
terrible aspect of the victim, who, after giving one or
two convulsive shudders, threw back his head with
glazed eyes and jaw relaxed, caused the trumpeter to
recede a pace or two, and throw down his gory
scourge, for some lingering sentiment of humanity,
which even the Dutch discipline of King William
had not extinguished, made him respect when dead
the man whom he had dishonoured when alive.
</p>

<p>
"The young Frenchman was dead!
</p>

<p>
"An exclamation of disgust and indignation that
escaped me woke up the Baron, who after drinking
deeply from a great pewter flask of skiedam that
hung at his saddlebow, muttered "schelms" several
times, rubbed his eyes, and then bellowed through
his trumpet to bind up the other prisoner.  Human
endurance could stand this no more, and though I
deemed the offer vain, I proposed to give a hundred
English guineas as ransom.
</p>

<p>
"'Ach Gott!' said the greedy Hollander immediately
becoming interested; "but vere you get zo mosh
guilder?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, readily, Mynheer Baron,' I replied, drawing
forth my pocket-book, 'I have here bills on his Grace
the Duke of Maryborough's paymaster and on the
Bank of Amsterdam for much more than that.'
</p>

<p>
"'Bot I cannot led off de brisoner for zo
little&mdash;hunder ponds&mdash;dat ver small&mdash;zay two.'
</p>

<p>
"If one is not enough, Mynheer Baron, I will
refer to the decision of his grace the captain-general.'
</p>

<p>
"'Ach, der tuyvel! vill you?' said the Dutchman,
with a savage gleam in his little eyes which showed
that he quite understood my hint, 'vell, me vont
quarrel vid you; gib me de bills and de schelm is
yours.'
</p>

<p>
"Resolving, nevertheless, to lay the whole affair
before Marlborough, the moment I reached our
trenches at Aire, I gave a bill for the required sum,
and approaching the other Frenchman requested him
to remain beside me; but he seemed too much
confused by grief, and cold, and horror to comprehend
what I said.  Poor fellow! his whole soul and
sympathies seemed absorbed in the mangled corpse of his
brother, which was now unbound from the halberts
and lay half sunk among the new-fallen snow.  While
he stooped over it, and hastily, but tenderly, proceeded
to draw the half-frozen clothing upon the stiffened
form, the orders of Van Wandenberg were heard
hoarsely through his speaking-trumpet, as they rang
over the desolate plain, and his troopers wheeled
back from a circle into line&mdash;from line into open
column of troops, and thereafter the torches were
extinguished and the march begun.  Slowly and
solemnly the dragoons glided away into the darkness,
each with a pyramid of snow rising from the steeple
crown and ample brims of his broad beaver hat.
</p>

<p>
"It was now almost midnight; the red moon had
waned, the snow-storm was increasing, and there
were I and the young Frenchman, with his brother's
corpse, left together on the wide plain, without a
place to shelter us."
</p>

<p>
"Proceed, Monsieur," said the Frenchman, as the
narrator paused; "for I am well aware that your story
ends not there."
</p>

<p>
"It does not&mdash;you seem interested; but I have
little more to relate, save that I dismounted and
assisted the poor Frenchman to raise the body from the
snow, and to tie it across the saddle of my horse,
taking the bridle in one hand, I supported him with
the other, and thus we proceeded to the nearest town."
</p>

<p>
"To Amientieres on the Lys," exclaimed the
Frenchman, seizing the hands of the Major as the
latter paused again; "to Armentieres, ten miles west
of Lisle, and there you left them, after adding to your
generosity by bestowing sufficient to inter his brother
in the Protestant church of that town, and to convey
himself to his native France.  Oh!  Monsieur, I am
that Frenchman, and here, from my heart, from my
soul, I thank you," and half kneeling, the stranger
kissed the hand of the Major.
</p>

<p>
"You!" exclaimed the latter; "by Jove I am
right glad to see you.  Here at Crail, too, in the East
Neuk o' Fife&mdash;'t is a strange chance; and what in
heaven's name seek ye here?  'T is a perilous time
for a foreigner&mdash;still more, a Frenchman, to tread on
Scottish ground.  The war, the intrigues with
St. Germains, the Popish plots, and the devil only knows
what more, make travelling here more than a little
dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, I know all that; the days are changed
since the Scot was at home in France, and the
Frenchman at home in Scotland, for so the old laws of
Stuart and Bourbon made them.  A few words
will tell who I am, and what I seek here.  Excuse my
reluctance to reveal myself before, for now you have
a claim upon me.  Oh! believe me, I knew not that
I addressed the generous chevalier who, in that hour
of despair, redeemed my life (and more than my life),
my honour, from the scourge, and enabled me to lay
the head of my poor brother with reverence in the
grave.  You have heard of M. Henri Lemercier?"
</p>

<p>
"What! the great swordsman and fencer&mdash;that
noble master of the science of defence, with the fame
of whose skill and valour all Europe is ringing?"
</p>

<p>
"I am he of whom Monsieur is pleased to speak
so highly."
</p>

<p>
"Your hand again, sir; zounds; but I dearly love
this gallant science myself, and have even won me a
little name as a handler of the rapier.  There is but
one man whom Europe calls your equal, Monsieur
Lemercier."
</p>

<p>
"My superior, you mean, for I have many equals,"
replied the Frenchman, modestly.  "You, doubtless,
mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sir William Hope, of Hopetoun."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Mon Dieu, yes, he has indeed a great name
in Europe as a fencer and master of arms, either with
double or single falchion, case of falchions,
back-sword and dagger, pistol or quarter staff; and it is
the fame of his skill and prowess in these weapons,
and the reputation he has earned by his books on
fencing, that hath brought me to-day to this remote
part of Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!" said the Major, shaking back the long
powdered curls of his Ramilies wig, and looking
remarkably grave; "you cannot mean to have a bout
with Sir William.  He hath a sure hand and a steady
eye; I would rather stand a platoon than be once
covered by his pistol."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, I have no enmity to this Sir William
Hope, nor am I envious of his great name as a
fencer.  Ma foi! the world is quite wide enough for
us both; but here lies my secret.  I love Mademoiselle
Athalie, the niece of Madame de Livry&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;the old flame of the great Louis!"
</p>

<p>
"Oui," said Lemercier, smiling; "and many say
that Athalie bears a somewhat suspicious resemblance
to her aunt's royal lover; but that is no business of
mine; she loves me very dearly, and is very good and
amiable.  Diable!  I am well content to take her and
her thirty thousand louis-d'or without making any
troublesome inquiries.  It would seem that my dear
little Athalie is immensely vain of my reputation as a
master of fence, and having heard that this Scottish
Chevalier is esteemed the first man of the sword in
Britain, and further, that report asserts he slew her
brother in the line of battle at Blenheim, fighting
bravely for a standard, she declared that ere her hand
was mine, I must measure swords with this Sir
William, and dip this, her handkerchief, in his blood
in token of his defeat, and of my conquest."
</p>

<p>
"A very pretty idea of Mademoiselle Athalie, and
I doubt not Hopetoun will be overwhelmed by the
obligation when he hears of it," said the Major of
Orkney's, whose face brightened with a broad laugh,
"and so much would I love to see two such brisk
fellows as thou and he yoked together, at cut-and-thrust,
that if permitted, I will rejoice in bearing the
message of M. Lemercier to Sir William, whose
Castle of Balcomie is close by here."
</p>

<p>
"Having no friend with me, I accept your offer
with a thousand thanks," said Lemercier.
</p>

<p>
"Sir William did indeed slay an officer, as you
have said, in that charge at Blenheim, where the
regiment of the Marquis de Livry were cut to pieces by
Orkney's Scots' Greys; but to be so good and amiable,
and to love you so much withal, Mademoiselle Athalie
must be a brisk dame to urge her favoured Chevalier
on a venture so desperate; for mark me, Monsieur
Lemercier," said the Major, impressively, "none can
know better than I the skill&mdash;the long and
carefully-studied skill&mdash;of Sir William of Hopetoun, and
permit me to warn you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It matters not&mdash;I must fight him; love, honour,
and rivalry, too, if you will have it so, all spur me on,
and no time must be lost."
</p>

<p>
"Enough; I should have been in my stirrups an
hour ago; and dark though the night be, I will ride to
Balcomie with your message."
</p>

<p>
"A million of thanks&mdash;you will choose time and
place for me."
</p>

<p>
"Say, to-morrow, at sunrise; be thou at the
Standing-stone of Sauchope; 't is a tall, rough block,
in the fields near the Castle of Balcomie, and doubt
not but Sir William will meet thee there."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, thanks," again said the Frenchman,
pressing the hand of the Major, who, apparently
delighted at the prospect of witnessing such an
encounter between the two most renowned swordsmen
in Europe, drank off his stoup of wine, muffled himself
in his rocquelaure, and with his little cocked hat
stuck jauntily on one side of the Ramilies wig, left the
apartment, and demanded his horse and the reckoning.
</p>

<p>
"Then your honour will be fulehardy, and tempt
Providence," said the landlord.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, gudeman, but you cannot tempt me to stay
just now.  I ride only through the town to Balcomie,
and will return anon.  The Hopetoun family are
there, I believe?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but saving my lady at the preachings, we
see little o' them; for Sir William has bidden at
Edinburgh, or elsewhere, since his English gold coft
the auld tower from the Balcomies of that Ilk, the year
before the weary Union, devil mend it!"
</p>

<p>
"Amen, say I; and what callest thou English gold?"
</p>

<p>
"The doolfu' compensation, o' whilk men say he
had his share."
</p>

<p>
"Man, thou liest, and they who say so lie! for to
the last moment his voice was raised against that
traitorous measure of Queensbury and Stair, and now
every energy of his soul is bent to its undoing!"
replied the Major, fiercely, as he put spurs to his horse,
and rode rapidly down the dark and then grassy
street, at the end of which the clank of his horse's
hoofs died away, as he diverged upon the open ground
that lay northward of the town, and by which he had
to approach the tower of Balcomie.
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman remained long buried in thought,
and as he sipped his wine, gazed dreamily on the
changing embers that glowed on the hearth, and cast
a warm light on the blue delft lining of the fireplace.
The reminiscences of the war in Flanders had called
up many a sad and many a bitter recollection.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather," thought he, "that the man I am
to encounter to-morrow was not a Scot, for the
kindness of to-night, and of that terrible night in the
snow-clad plain of Arras, inspire me with a warm love
for all the people of this land.  But my promise must
be redeemed, my adventure achieved, or thou, my
dear, my rash Athalie, art lost to me!" and he paused
to gaze with earnestness upon a jewel that glittered
on his hand.  It was a hair ring, bound with gold,
and a little shield bearing initials, clasped the small
brown tress that was so ingeniously woven round it.
</p>

<p>
As he gazed on the trinket, his full dark eyes
brightened for a moment, as the mild memories of
love and fondness rose in his heart, and a bright
smile played upon his haughty lip and lofty brow.
Other thoughts arose, and the eyebrows that almost
met over the straight Grecian nose of Lemercier,
were knit as he recalled the ominous words of his
recent acquaintance&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle Athalie must be a brisk dame to
urge her favoured Chevalier on a venture so
desperate."
</p>

<p>
One bitter pang shot through his heart, but he
thrust the thought aside, and pressed the ring to his
lips.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Athalie," he said, in a low voice, "I were
worse than a villain to suspect thee."
</p>

<p>
At that moment midnight tolled from the dull old
bell of Crail, and the strangeness of the sound
brought keenly home to the lonely heart of Lemercier
that he was in a foreign land.
</p>

<p>
The hour passed, but the Major did not return.
</p>

<p>
Morning came.
</p>

<p>
With gray dawn Lemercier was awake, and a few
minutes found him dressed and ready.  He attired
himself with particular care, putting on a coat and
vest, the embroidery of which presented as few
conspicuous marks as possible to an antagonist's eye.
He clasped his coat from the cravat to the waist, and
compressed his embroidered belt.  He adjusted his
white silk roll-up stockings with great exactness;
tied up the flowing curls of his wig with a white
ribbon, placed a scarlet feather in his hat, and then took
his sword.  The edge and point of the blade, the
shell and pommel, grasp and guard of the hilt were
all examined with scrupulous care for the last time;
he drew on his gloves with care, and giving to the
landlord the reckoning, which he might never
return to pay, Lemercier called for his horse and rode
through the main street of Crail.
</p>

<p>
Following the directions he had received from his
host, he hastily quitted the deserted and grass-grown
street of the burgh (the very aspect of which he
feared would chill him), and proceeded towards the
ancient obelisk, still known as the "Standing Stone
of Sauchope," which had been named as the place of
rendezvous by that messenger who had not returned,
and against whom M. Lemercier felt his anger a little
excited.
</p>

<p>
It was a cool March morning, the sky was clear
and blue, and the few silver clouds that floated
through it became edged with gold as the sun rose
from his bed in the eastern sea&mdash;that burnished sea
from which the cool fresh breeze swept over the level
coast.  The fields were assuming a vernal greenness,
the buds were swelling on hedge and tree, and the
vegetation of the summer that was to come&mdash;the
summer that Lemercier might never see&mdash;was springing
from amid the brown remains of the autumn
that had gone, an autumn that he had passed with
Athalie amid the gaieties and gardens of Paris and
Versailles.
</p>

<p>
At the distance of a mile he saw the strong square
tower of Balcomie, the residence of his antagonist.
One side was involved in shadow, the other shone
redly in the rising sun, and the morning smoke from
its broad chimneys curled in dusky columns into the
blue sky.  The caw of the rooks that followed the
plough, whose shining share turned up the aromatic
soil, the merry whistle of the bonneted plough-boys,
the voices of the blackbird and the mavis, made him
sad, and pleased was Lemercier to leave behind him
all such sounds of life, and reach the wild and
solitary place where the obelisk stood&mdash;a grim and
time-worn relic of the Druid ages or the Danish wars.  A
rough mis-shapen remnant of antiquity, it still remains
to mark the scene of this hostile meeting, which yet
forms one of the most famous traditions of the East
Neuk.
</p>

<p>
As Lemercier rode up, he perceived a gentleman
standing near the stone.  His back was towards him,
and he was apparently intent on caressing his charger,
whose reins he had thrown negligently over his arm.
</p>

<p>
Lemercier thought he recognised the hat, edged
with white feathers, the full-bottomed wig, and the
peculiar lacing of the white velvet coat, and on the
stranger turning he immediately knew his friend of
the preceding night.
</p>

<p>
"Bon jour, my dear sir," said Lemercier
</p>

<p>
"A good morning."  replied the other, and they
politely raised their little cocked hats.
</p>

<p>
"I had some misgivings when monsieur did not
return to me," said the Frenchman.  "Sir William
has accepted my challenge?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monsieur, and is now before you," replied
the other, springing on horseback.  "I am Sir
William Hope, of Hopetoun, and am here at your
service."
</p>

<p>
"You!" exclaimed the Frenchman, in tones of
blended astonishment and grief.  "Ah! unsay what
you have said.  I cannot point my sword against the
breast of my best benefactor&mdash;against him to whom
I owe both honour and life.  Can I forget that night
on the plains of Arras?  Ah, my God! what a mistake:
what a misfortune.  Ah, Athalie! to what have
you so unthinkingly urged me?"
</p>

<p>
"Think of her only, and forget all of me, save that
I am your antagonist, your enemy, as I stand between
thee and her.  Come on, M. Lemercier, do not forget
your promise to mademoiselle; we will sheathe our
swords on the first blood drawn."
</p>

<p>
"So be it then, if the first is thine," and
unsheathing their long and keen-edged rapiers, they put
spurs to their horses, and closing up hand to hand,
engaged with admirable skill and address.
</p>

<p>
The skill of one swordsman seemed equalled only
by that of the other.
</p>

<p>
Lemercier was the first fencer at the Court of
France, where fencing was an accomplishment known
to all, and there was no man in Britain equal to Sir
William Hope, whose "Complete Fencing Master"
was long famous among the lovers of the noble science
of defence.
</p>

<p>
They rode round each other in circles.  Warily and
sternly they began to watch each other's eyes, till
they flashed in unison with their blades; their hearts
beat quicker as their passions became excited and
their rivalry roused; and their nerves became strung
as the hope of conquest was whetted.  The wish of
merely being wounded ended in a desire to wound;
and the desire to wound in a clamorous anxiety to
vanquish and destroy.  Save the incessant clash of
the notched rapiers, as each deadly thrust was
adroitly parried and furiously repeated, the straining
of stirrup-leathers, as each fencer swayed to and fro
in his saddle, their suppressed breathing, and the
champing of iron bits, Lemercier and his foe saw
nothing but the gleam, and heard nothing but the
clash of each other's glittering swords.
</p>

<p>
The sun came up in his glory from the shining
ocean; the mavis soared above them in the blue sky;
the early flowers of spring were unfolding their dewy
cups to the growing warmth, but still man fought
with man, and the hatred in their hearts waxed fierce
and strong.
</p>

<p>
In many places their richly-laced coats were cut
and torn.  One lost his hat, and had received a
severe scar on the forehead, and the other had one on
his bridle hand.  They often paused breathlessly,
and in weariness lowered the points of their weapons
to glare upon each other with a ferocity that could
have no end but death&mdash;until at the sixth encounter,
when Lemercier became exhausted, and failing to
parry with sufficient force a fierce and furious thrust,
was run through the breast so near the heart, that he
fell from his horse gasping and weltering in blood.
</p>

<p>
Sir William Hope flung away his rapier and sprang
to his assistance, but the unfortunate Frenchman
could only draw from his finger the ring of Athalie,
and with her name on his lips expired&mdash;being actually
choked in his own blood.
</p>

<p>
Such was the account of this combat given by the
horrified Master Spiggot, who, suspecting "that there
was something wrong," had followed his guest to the
scene of the encounter, the memory of which is still
preserved in the noble house of Hopetoun, and the
legends of the burghers of Crail.
</p>

<p>
So died Lemercier.
</p>

<p>
Of what Sir William said or thought on the occasion,
we have no record.  In the good old times he
would have eased his conscience by the endowment
of an altar, or foundation of a yearly mass; but in
the year 1708 such things had long been a dead
letter in the East Neuk; and so in lieu thereof, he
interred him honourably in the aisle of the ancient
kirk, where a marble tablet long marked the place of
his repose.
</p>

<p>
Sir William did more; he carefully transmitted
the ring of Lemercier to the bereaved Athalie, but
before its arrival in Paris she had dried her tears for
the poor chevalier, and wedded one of his numerous
rivals.  Thus, she forgot him sooner than his
conqueror, who reached a good old age, and died at his
castle of Balcomie, with his last breath regretting
the combat of that morning at the Standing Stone of
Sauchope.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
THE PHANTOM REGIMENT&mdash;THE QUARTERMASTER'S STORY.
</h3>

<p>
Though the continued march of intellect and
education have nearly obliterated from the mind of the
Scots a belief in the marvellous, still a love of the
supernatural lingers among the more mountainous
districts of the northern kingdom; for "the Schoolmaster"
finds it no easy task, even when aided by
all the light of science, to uproot the prejudices of
more than two thousand years.
</p>

<p>
I was born in Strathnairn, about the year 1802, and,
on the death of my mother, was given, when an
infant, to the wife of a cotter to nurse.  With these good
people I remained for some years, and thus became
cognizant of the facts I am about to relate.
</p>

<p>
There was a little romance connected with my old
nurse Meinie and her gudeman.
</p>

<p>
In their younger days they had been lovers&mdash;lovers
as a boy and girl&mdash;but were separated by poverty,
and then Ewen Mac Ewen enlisted as a soldier, in
the 26th or Cameronian Regiment, with which he saw
some sharp service in the West Indies and America.
The light-hearted young highlander became, in time,
a grave, stern, and morose soldier, with the most
rigid ideas of religious deportment and propriety:
for this distinguished Scottish regiment was of
Puritan origin, being one of those raised among the
Westland Covenanters, after the deposition of king
James VII. by the Estates of Scotland.  England
surrendered to William of Orange without striking a
blow; but the defence of Dunkeld, and the victorious
battle of Killycrankie, ended the northern campaign,
in which the noble Dundee was slain, and the army
of the cavaliers dispersed.  The Cameronian Regiment
introduced their sectarian forms, their rigorous
discipline, and plain mode of public worship into
their own ranks, and so strict was their code of morals,
that even the Non-jurors and Jacobins admitted the
excellence and stern propriety of their bearing.
They left the Scottish Service for the British, at the
Union, in 1707, but still wear on their appointments
the five-pointed star, which was the armorial bearing
of the colonel who embodied them; and, moreover,
retain the privilege of supplying their own
regimental Bibles.
</p>

<p>
After many years of hard fighting in the old 26th,
and after carrying a halbert in the kilted regiment
of the Isles, Ewen Mac Ewen returned home to his
native place, the great plain of Moray, a graver, and,
in bearing, a sadder man than when he left it.
</p>

<p>
His first inquiry was for Meinie.
</p>

<p>
She had married a rival of his, twenty years ago.
</p>

<p>
"God's will be done," sighed Ewen, as he lifted
his bonnet, and looked upwards.
</p>

<p>
He built himself a little cottage, in the old highland
fashion, in his native strath, at a sunny spot,
where the Uisc Nairn&mdash;the Water of Alders&mdash;flowed in
front, and a wooded hill arose behind.  He hung his
knapsack above the fireplace; deposited his old and
sorely thumbed regimental Bible (with the Cameronian
star on its boards,) and the tin case containing his
colonel's letter recommending him to the minister,
and the discharge, which gave sixpence per diem as
the reward of sixteen battles&mdash;all on the shelf of the
little window, which contained three panes of glass,
with a yoke in the centre of each, and there he
settled himself down in peace, to plant his own kail,
knit his own hose, and to make his own kilts, a grave
and thoughtful but contented old fellow, awaiting the
time, as he said, "when the Lord would call him away."
</p>

<p>
Now it chanced that a poor widow, with several
children, built herself a little thatched house on the
opposite side of the drove road&mdash;an old Fingalian
path&mdash;which ascended the pastoral glen; and the
ready-handed veteran lent his aid to thatch it, and
to sling her kail-pot on the cruicks, and was wont
thereafter to drop in of an evening to smoke his pipe,
to tell old stories of the storming of Ticonderago, and
to ask her little ones the catechism and biblical
questions.  Within a week or so, he discovered that the
widow was Meinie&mdash;the ripe, blooming Meinie of
other years&mdash;an old, a faded, and a sad-eyed woman
now; and poor Ewen's lonely heart swelled within
him, as he thought of all that had passed since last
they met, and as he spake of what they were, and what
they might have been, had fate been kind, or fortune
roved more true.
</p>

<p>
We have heard much about the hidden and mysterious
principle of affinity, and more about the
sympathy and sacredness that belong to a first and
early love; well, the heart of the tough old Cameronian
felt these gentle impulses, and Meinie was no
stranger to them.  They were married, and for fifteen
years, there was no happier couple on the banks of
the Nairn.  Strange to say, they died on the same
day, and were interred in the ancient burying-ground
of Dalcross, where now they lie, near the ruined walls
of the old vicarage kirk of the Catholic times.  God
rest them in their humble highland graves!  My father,
who was the minister of Croy, acted as chief
mourner, and gave the customary funeral prayer.
But I am somewhat anticipating, and losing the
thread of my own story in telling theirs.
</p>

<p>
In process of time the influx of French and
English tourists who came to visit the country of the
clans, and to view the plain of Culloden, after the
publication of "Waverley" gave to all Britain, that
which we name in Scotland "the tartan fever," and
caused the old path which passed the cot of Ewen to
become a turnpike road; a tollbar&mdash;that most
obnoxious of all impositions to a Celt&mdash;was placed
across the mouth of the little glen, barring the way
directly to the battle-field; and of this gate the old
pensioner Ewen naturally became keeper; and during
the summer season, when, perhaps, a hundred
carriages per day rolled through, it became a source of
revenue alike to him, and to the Lord of Cawdor
and the Laird of Kilravock, the road trustees.  And
the chief pleasure of Ewen's existence was to sit on
a thatched seat by the gate, for then he felt
conscious of being in office&mdash;on duty&mdash;a species of
sentinel; and it smacked of the old time when the
Generale was beaten in the morning, and the drums
rolled tattoo at night; when he had belts to
pipeclay, and boots to blackball; when there were wigs
to frizzle and queues to tie, and to be all trim and in
order to meet Monseigneur le Marquis de Montcalm,
or General Washington "right early in the morning;"
and there by the new barrier of the glen
Ewen sat the live-long day, with spectacles on nose,
and the Cameronian Bible on his knee, as he spelled his
way through Deuteronomy and the tribes of Judah.
</p>

<p>
Slates in due time replaced the green thatch of his
little cottage; then a diminutive additional story,
with two small dormer windows, was added thereto,
and the thrifty Meinie placed a paper in her window
informing shepherds, the chance wayfarers, and the
wandering deer-stalkers that she had a room to let;
but summer passed away, the sportsman forsook the
brown scorched mountains, the gay tourist ceased to
come north, and the advertisement turned from white
to yellow, and from yellow to flyblown green in her
window; the winter snows descended on the hills,
the pines stood in long and solemn ranks by the white
frozen Nairn, but "the room upstairs" still
remained without a tenant.
</p>

<p>
Anon the snow passed away, the river again flowed
free, the flowers began to bloom; the young grass
to sprout by the hedgerows, and the mavis to sing on
the fauld-dykes, for spring was come again, and
joyous summer soon would follow; and one night&mdash;it
was the 26th of April&mdash;Ewen was exhibiting his
penmanship in large text-hand by preparing the new
announcement of "a room to let," when he paused,
and looked up as a peal of thunder rumbled across
the sky; a red gleam of lightning flashed in the
darkness without, and then they heard the roar of
the deep broad Nairn, as its waters, usually so sombre
and so slow, swept down from the wilds of Badenoch,
flooded with the melting snows of the past winter.
</p>

<p>
A dreadful storm of thunder, rain, and wind came
on, and the little cottage rocked on its foundations;
frequently the turf-fire upon the hearth was almost
blown about the clay-floor, by the downward gusts
that bellowed in the chimney.  The lightning
gleamed incessantly, and seemed to play about the
hill of Urchany and the ruins of Caistel Fionlah; the
woods groaned and creaked, and the trees seemed to
shriek as their strong limbs were torn asunder by
the gusts which in some places laid side by side the
green sapling of last summer, and the old oak that
had stood for a thousand years&mdash;that had seen
Macbeth and Duncan ride from Nairn, and had outlived
the wars of the Comyns and the Clanchattan.
</p>

<p>
The swollen Nairn tore down its banks, and swept
trees, rocks, and stones in wild confusion to
the sea, mingling the pines of Aberarder with
the old oaks of Cawdor; while the salt spray
from the Moray Firth was swept seven miles
inland, where it encrusted with salt the trees, the
houses, and windows, and whatever it fell on
as it mingled with the ceaseless rain, while deep,
hoarse, and loud the incessant thunder rattled across
the sky, "as if all the cannon on earth," according
to Ewen, "were exchanging salvoes between Urchany
and the Hill of Geddes."
</p>

<p>
Meinie grew pale, and sat with a finger on her
mouth, and a startled expression in her eyes, listening
to the uproar without; four children, two of whom
were Ewen's, and her last addition to the clan, clung
to her skirts.
</p>

<p>
Ewen had just completed the invariable prayer
and chapter for the night, and was solemnly depositing
his old regimental companion, with "Baxter's
Saints' Best," in a place of security, when a
tremendous knock&mdash;a knock that rang above the
storm&mdash;shook the door of the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Who can this be, and in such a night?" said
Meinie.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord knoweth," responded Ewen, gravely;
"but he knocks both loud and late."
</p>

<p>
"Inquire before you open," urged Meinie, seizing
her husband's arm, as the impatient knock was
renewed with treble violence.
</p>

<p>
"Who comes there?" demanded Ewen, in a
soldierly tone.
</p>

<p>
"A friend," replied a strange voice without, and in
the same manner.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Fire and smoke!" cried the other, giving the
door a tremendous kick; "do you ask that in such a
devil of a night as this?  You have a room to let,
have you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well: open the door, or blood and 'oons I'll bite
your nose off!"
</p>

<p>
Ewen hastened to undo the door; and then, all
wet and dripping as if he had just been fished up
from the Moray Firth, there entered a strange-looking
old fellow in a red coat; he stumped vigorously on a
wooden leg, and carried on his shoulders a box, which
he flung down with a crash that shook the dwelling,
saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;dam you&mdash;I have made good my billet at last."
</p>

<p>
"So it seems," said Ewen, reclosing the door in
haste to exclude the tempest, lest his house should
be unroofed and torn asunder.
</p>

<p>
"Harkee, comrade, what garrison or fortress is
this," asked the visitor, "that peaceable folks are to
be challenged in this fashion, and forced to give
parole and countersign before they march in&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"It is my house, comrade; and so you had better
keep a civil tongue in your head."
</p>

<p>
"Civil tongue?  Fire and smoke, you mangy cur!
I can be as civil as my neighbours; but get me a
glass of grog, for I am as wet as we were the night
before Minden."
</p>

<p>
"Where have you come from in such a storm as this?"
</p>

<p>
"Where you'd not like to go&mdash;so never mind; but,
grog, I tell you&mdash;get me some grog, and a bit of
tobacco; it is long since I tasted either."
</p>

<p>
Ewen hastened to get a large quaighful of stiff
Glenlivat, which the veteran drained to his health,
and that of Meinie; but first he gave them a most
diabolical grin, and threw into the liquor some black
stuff, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I always mix my grog with gunpowder&mdash;it's a
good tonic; I learned that of a comrade who fell at
Minden on the glorious 1st of August, '59.
</p>

<p>
"You have been a soldier, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Right!  I was one of the 25th, or old
Edinburgh Regiment; they enlisted me, though an
Englishman, I believe; for my good old dam was a
follower of the camp."
</p>

<p>
"Our number was the 26th&mdash;the old Cameronian
Regiment&mdash;so we were near each other, you see,
comrade."
</p>

<p>
"Nearer than you would quite like, mayhap," said
Wooden-leg, with another grin and a dreadful oath.
</p>

<p>
"And you have served in Germany?" asked Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"Germany&mdash;aye, and marched over every foot of
it, from Hanover to Hell, and back again.  I have
fought in Flanders, too."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you had come a wee while sooner," said
Ewen gravely, for this discourse startled his sense
of propriety.
</p>

<p>
"Sooner," snarled this shocking old fellow, who
must have belonged to that army, "which swore so
terribly in Flanders," as good Uncle Toby says;
"sooner&mdash;for what?"
</p>

<p>
"To have heard me read a chapter, and to have
joined us in prayer."
</p>

<p>
"Prayers be d&mdash;ned!" cried the other, with a shout
of laughter, and a face expressive of fiendish mockery,
as he gave his wooden leg a thundering blow on
the floor; "fire and smoke&mdash;another glass of grog&mdash;and
then we'll settle about my billet upstairs."
</p>

<p>
While getting another dram, which hospitality
prevented him from refusing, Ewen scrutinised this
strange visitor, whose aspect and attire were very
remarkable; but wholly careless of what any one
thought, he sat by the hearth, wringing his wet wig,
and drying it at the fire.
</p>

<p>
He was a little man, of a spare, but strong and
active figure, which indicated great age; his face
resembled that of a rat; behind it hung a long
queue that waved about like a pendulum when he
moved his head, which was quite bald, and smooth
as a cricket-ball, save where a long and livid
scar&mdash;evidently a sword cut&mdash;traversed it.  This was
visible while he sat drying his wig; but as that process
was somewhat protracted, he uttered an oath, and
thrust his cocked hat on one side of his head, and
very much over his left eye, which was covered by a
patch.  This head-dress was the old military
triple-cocked hat, bound with yellow braid, and having on
one side the hideous black leather cockade of the
House of Hanover, now happily disused in the
British army, and retained as a badge of service by
liverymen alone.  His attire was an old threadbare
red coat, faced with yellow, having square tails and
deep cuffs, with braided holes; he wore knee-breeches
on his spindle shanks, one of which terminated,
as I have said, in a wooden pin; he carried
a large knotted stick; and, in outline and aspect,
very much resembled, as Ewen thought, Frederick
the Great of Prussia, or an old Chelsea pensioner,
or the soldiers he had seen delineated in antique
prints of the Flemish wars.  His solitary orb
possessed a most diabolical leer, and, whichever way
you turned, it seemed to regard you with the fixed
glare of a basilisk.
</p>

<p>
"You are a stranger hereabout, I presume?" said
Ewen drily.
</p>

<p>
"A stranger now, certainly; but I was pretty
well known in this locality once.  There are some
bones buried hereabout that may remember me,"
he replied, with a grin that showed his fangless
jaws.
</p>

<p>
"Bones!" reiterated Ewen, aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, bones&mdash;Culloden Muir lies close by here,
does it not?"
</p>

<p>
"It does&mdash;then you have travelled this road
before?"
</p>

<p>
"Death and the Devil!  I should think so,
comrade; on this very night sixty years ago I marched
along this road, from Nairn to Culloden, with the
army of His Royal Highness, the Great Duke of
Cumberland, Captain-General of the British troops,
in pursuit of the rebels under the Popish Pretender&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Under His Royal Highness Prince Charles, you
mean, comrade," said Ewen, in whose breast&mdash;Cameronian
though he was&mdash;a tempest of Highland
wrath and loyalty swelled up at these words.
</p>

<p>
"Prince&mdash;ha! ha! ha!" laughed the other; "had
you said as much then, the gallows had been your
doom.  Many a man I have shot, and many a boy
I have brained with the butt end of my musket, for
no other crime than wearing the tartan, even as you
this night wear it."
</p>

<p>
Ewen made a forward stride as if he would have
taken the wicked boaster by the throat; his anger
was kindled to find himself in presence of a
veritable soldier of the infamous "German Butcher,"
whose merciless massacre of the wounded clansmen
and their defenceless families will never be
forgotten in Scotland while oral tradition and written
record exist; but Ewen paused, and said in his quiet
way,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Blessed be the Lord! these times and things
have passed away from the land, to return to it no
more.  We are both old men now; by your own
reckoning, you must at least have numbered four-score
years, and in that, you are by twenty my better
man.  You are my guest to-night, moreover, so we
must not quarrel, comrade.  My father was killed at
Culloden."
</p>

<p>
"On which side?"
</p>

<p>
"The right one&mdash;for he fell by the side of old
Keppoch, and his last words were, 'Righ Hamish
gu Bragh!'"
</p>

<p>
"Fire and smoke!" laughed the old fellow, "I
remember these things as if they only happened
yesterday&mdash;mix me some more grog and put it in
the bill&mdash;I was the company's butcher in those days&mdash;it
suited my taste&mdash;so when I was not stabbing and
slashing the sheep and cattle of the rascally
commissary, I was cutting the throats of the Scots and
French, for there were plenty of them, and Irish
too, who fought against the king's troops in
Flanders.  We had hot work, that day at Culloden&mdash;hotter
than at Minden, where we fought in heavy
marching order, with our blankets, kettles, and
provisions, on a broiling noon, when the battle-field was
cracking under a blazing sun, and the whole country
was sweltering like the oven of the Great Baker."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"What! you don't know him?  Ha! ha! ha!
Ho! ho! ho! come, that is good."
</p>

<p>
Ewen expostulated with the boisterous old fellow
on this style of conversation, which, as you may
easily conceive, was very revolting to the prejudices
of a well-regulated Cameronian soldier.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, you old devilskin," cried the other,
stirring up the fire with his wooden leg, till the
sparks flashed and gleamed like his solitary eye; "you
may as well sing psalms to a dead horse, as preach
to me.  Hark how the thunder roars, like the great
guns at Carthagena!  More grog&mdash;put it in the
bill&mdash;or, halt, d&mdash;me! pay yourself," and he dashed on
the table a handful of silver of the reigns of George
II., and the Glencoe assassin, William of Orange.
</p>

<p>
He obtained more whiskey, and drank it raw,
seasoning it from time to time with gunpowder,
just as an Arab does his cold water with ginger.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you lose your eye, comrade?"
</p>

<p>
"At Culloden; but I found the fellow who pinked
me, next day, as he lay bleeding on the field; he
was a Cameron, in a green velvet jacket, all covered
with silver; so I stripped off his lace, as I had seen
my mother do, and then I brained him with the
butt-end of brown-bess&mdash;and before his wife's eyes,
too!  What the deuce do you growl at, comrade?
Such things will happen in war, and you know that
orders must be obeyed.  My eye was gone&mdash;but it
was the left one, and I was saved the trouble of
closing it when taking aim.  This slash on the
sconce I got at the battle of Preston Pans, from the
Celt who slew Colonel Gardiner."
</p>

<p>
"That Celt was my father&mdash;the Miller of
Invernahyle," said Meinie, proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Your father! fire and smoke! do you say so?
His hand was a heavy one!" cried Wooden-leg,
while his eye glowed like the orb of a hyæna.
</p>

<p>
"And your leg?"
</p>

<p>
"I lost at Minden, in Kingsley's Brigade,
comrade; aye, my leg&mdash;d&mdash;n!&mdash;that was indeed a loss."
</p>

<p>
"A warning to repentance, I would say."
</p>

<p>
"Then you would say wrong.  Ugh!  I remember
when the shot&mdash;a twelve-pounder&mdash;took me
just as we were rushing with charged bayonets on
the French cannoniers.  Smash! my leg was gone,
and I lay sprawling and bleeding in a ploughed
field near the Weser, while my comrades swept over
me with a wild hurrah! the colours waving, and
drums beating a charge."
</p>

<p>
"And what did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"I lay there and swore, believe me."
</p>

<p>
"That would not restore your limb again."
</p>

<p>
"No; but a few hearty oaths relieve the mind;
and the mind relieves the body; you understand
me, comrade; so there I lay all night under a storm
of rain like this, bleeding and sinking; afraid of
the knives of the plundering death-hunters, for my
mother had been one, and I remembered well how
she looked after the wounded, and cured them of
their agony."
</p>

<p>
"Was your mother one of those infer&mdash;&mdash;" began
MacEwen.
</p>

<p>
"Don't call her hard names now, comrade; she died
on the day after the defeat at Val; with the Provost
Marshal's cord round her neck&mdash;a cordon less
ornamental than that of St. Louis."
</p>

<p>
"And your father?"
</p>

<p>
"Was one of Howard's Regiment; but which the
devil only knows, for it was a point on which the
old lady, honest woman, had serious doubts herself."
</p>

<p>
"After the loss of your leg, of course you left the
service?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I became the company's butcher; but, fire
and smoke, get me another glass of grog; take a
share yourself, and don't sit staring at me like a Dutch
Souterkin conceived of a winter night over a 'pot de
feu,' as all the world knows King William was.  Dam! let
us be merry together&mdash;ha, ha, ha! ho, ho, ho! and
I'll sing you a song of the old whig times."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'O, brother Sandie, hear ye the news,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lillibulero, bullen a la!<br />
  An army is coming sans breeches and shoes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lillibulero, bullen a la!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'To arms! to arms! brave boys to arms!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true British cause for your courage doth ca';<br />
  Country and city against a kilted banditti,<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And while he continued to rant and sing the song
(once so obnoxious to the Scottish Cavaliers), he beat
time with his wooden leg, and endeavoured to outroar
the stormy wind and the hiss of the drenching rain.
Even MacEwen, though he was an old soldier, felt
some uneasiness, and Meinie trembled in her heart,
while the children clung to her skirts and hid their
little faces, as if this singing, riot, and jollity were
impious at such a time, when the awful thunder
was ringing its solemn peals across the midnight sky.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
THE PHANTOM REGIMENT.&mdash;THE UNCO' QUEST.
</h3>

<p>
Although this strange old man baffled or parried
every inquiry of Ewen as to whence he had come,
and how and why he wore that antiquated uniform,
on his making a lucrative offer to take the upper
room of the little toll-house for a year&mdash;exactly a
year&mdash;when Ewen thought of his poor pension of
six-pence per diem, of their numerous family, and Meinie
now becoming old and requiring many little comforts,
all scruples were overcome by the pressure of
necessity, and the mysterious old soldier was duly
installed in the attic, with his corded chest, scratch-wig,
and wooden-leg; moreover, he paid the first six
months' rent in advance, dashing the money&mdash;which
was all coin of the first and second Georges, on the
table with a bang and an oath, swearing that he
disliked being indebted to any man.
</p>

<p>
The next morning was calm and serene; the green
hills lifted their heads into the blue and placid sky.
There was no mist on the mountains, nor rain in the
valley.  The flood in the Nairn had subsided, though
its waters were still muddy and perturbed; but save
this, and the broken branches that strewed the
wayside&mdash;with an uprooted tree, or a paling laid flat on
the ground, there was no trace of yesterday's
hurricane, and Ewen heard Wooden-leg (he had no other
name for his new lodger) stumping about overhead,
as the old fellow left his bed betimes, and after
trimming his queue and wig, pipeclaying his yellow
facings, and beating them well with the brush, in a
soldier-like way, he descended to breakfast, but,
disdaining porridge and milk, broiled salmon and
bannocks of barley-meal, he called for a can of stiff grog,
mixed it with powder from his wide waistcoat pocket,
and drank it off at a draught.  Then he imperiously
desired Ewen to take his bonnet and staff, and
accompany him so far as Culloden, "because," said he,
"I have come a long, long way to see the old place
again."
</p>

<p>
Wooden-leg seemed to gather&mdash;what was quite
unnecessary to him&mdash;new life, vigour, and energy&mdash;as
they traversed the road that led to the battle-field,
and felt the pure breeze of the spring morning
blowing on their old and wrinkled faces.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere was charmingly clear and serene.
In the distance lay the spires of Inverness, and the
shining waters of the Moray Firth, studded with sails,
and the ramparts of Fort George were seen jutting
out at the termination of a long and green peninsula.
In the foreground stood the castle of Dalcross,
raising its square outline above a wood, which terminates
the eastern side of the landscape.  The pine-clad
summit of Dun Daviot incloses the west, while on every
hand between, stretched the dreary moor of
Drummossie&mdash;the Plain of Culloden&mdash;whilome drenched in
the blood of Scotland's bravest hearts.
</p>

<p>
Amid the purple heath lie two or three grass-covered
mounds.
</p>

<p>
These are the graves of the dead&mdash;the graves of
the loyal Highlanders, who fell on that disastrous
field, and of the wounded, who were so mercilessly
murdered next day by an order of Cumberland, which
he pencilled on the back of a card (the Nine of
Diamonds); thus they were dispatched by platoons,
stabbed by bayonets, slashed by swords and
spontoons, or brained by the butt-end of musket and
carbine; officers and men were to be seen emulating
each other in this scene of cowardice and cold-blooded
atrocity, which filled every camp and barrack
in Continental Europe with scorn at the name of an
English soldier.
</p>

<p>
Ewen was a Highlander, and his heart filled with
such thoughts as these, when he stood by the grassy
tombs where the fallen brave are buried with the
hopes of the house they died for; he took off his
bonnet and stood bare-headed, full of sad and silent
contemplation; while his garrulous companion
viewed the field with his single eye, that glowed like
a hot coal, and pirouetted on his wooden pin in a very
remarkable manner, as he surveyed on every side the
scene of that terrible encounter, where, after
enduring a long cannonade of round shot and grape, the
Highland swordsmen, chief and gillie, the noble and
the nameless, flung themselves with reckless valour
on the ranks of those whom they had already routed
in two pitched battles.
</p>

<p>
"It was an awful day," said Ewen, in a low voice, but
with a gleam in his grey Celtic eye; "yonder my
father fell wounded; the bullet went through his shield
and pierced him here, just above the belt; he was
living next day, when my mother&mdash;a poor wailing
woman with a babe at her breast&mdash;found him; but an
officer of Barrel's Regiment ran a sword twice through
his body and killed him; for the orders of the
German Duke were, 'that no quarter should be given.'  This
spring is named MacGillivray's Well, because
here they butchered the dying chieftain who led the
Macintoshes&mdash;aye bayonetted him, next day at noon,
in the arms of his bonnie young wife and his puir
auld mother!  The inhuman monsters!  I have been
a soldier," continued Ewen, "and I have fought for
my country; but had I stood that day on this Moor
of Culloden, I would have shot the German Butcher, the
coward who fled from Flanders&mdash;I would, by the God
who hears me, though that moment had been my last!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!  Ho, ho, ho!" rejoined his queer
companion.  "It seems like yesterday since I was
here; I don't see many changes, except that the
dead are all buried, whereas we left them to the
crows, and a carriage-road has been cut across the
field, just where we seized some women, who were
looking among the dead for their husbands, and
who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
Wooden-leg whistled, and gave Ewen a diabolical
leer with his snaky eye, as he resumed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I see the ridge where the clans formed line&mdash;every
tribe with its chief in front, and his colours in
the centre, when we, hopeless of victory, and thinking
only of defeat, approached them; and I can yet
see standing the old stone wall which covered their
right flank.  Fire and smoke! it was against that
wall we placed the wounded, when we fired at them
by platoons next day.  I finished some twenty rebels
there myself."
</p>

<p>
Ewen's hand almost caught the haft of his skene
dhu, as he said, hoarsely,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Old man, do not call them rebels in my hearing,
and least of all by the graves where they lie; they
were good men and true; if they were in error, they
have long since answered to God for it, even as we
one day must answer; therefore let us treat their
memory with respect, as soldiers should ever treat
their brothers in arms who fall in war."
</p>

<p>
But Wooden-leg laughed with his strange eldritch
yell, and then they returned together to the tollhouse
in the glen; but Ewen felt strongly dissatisfied with
his lodger, whose conversation was so calculated to
shock alike his Jacobitical and his religious
prejudices.  Every day this sentiment grew stronger, and
he soon learned to deplore in his inmost heart having
ever accepted the rent, and longed for the time when
he should be rid of him; but, at the end of the six
months, Wooden-leg produced the rent for the
remainder of the year, still in old silver of the two
first Georges, with a few Spanish dollars, and swore
he would set the house on fire, if Ewen made any
more apologies about their inability to make him
sufficiently comfortable and so forth; for his host
and hostess had resorted to every pretence and
expedient to rid themselves of him handsomely.
</p>

<p>
But Wooden-leg was inexorable.
</p>

<p>
He had bargained for his billet for a year; he had
paid for it; and a year he would stay, though the
Lord Justice General of Scotland himself should
say nay!
</p>

<p>
Boisterous and authoritative, he awed every one by
his terrible gimlet eye and the volleys of oaths
with which he overwhelmed them on suffering the
smallest contradiction; thus he became the terror of
all; and shepherds crossed the hills by the most
unfrequented routes rather than pass the toll-bar,
where they vowed that his eye bewitched their sheep
and cattle.  To every whispered and stealthy inquiry
as to where his lodger had come from, and how or
why he had thrust himself upon this lonely tollhouse,
Ewen could only groan and shrug his shoulders, or
reply,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He came on the night of the hurricane, like
a bird of evil omen; but on the twenty-sixth of
April we will be rid of him, please Heaven!  It is
close at hand, and he shall march then, sure as my
name is Ewen Mac Ewen!"
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be troubled in his conscience, too, or
to have strange visitors; for often in stormy nights
he was heard swearing or threatening, and expostulating;
and once or twice, when listening at the foot
of the stair, Ewen heard him shouting and conversing
from his window with persons on the road, although
the bar was shut, locked, and there was no one
visible there.
</p>

<p>
On another windy night, Ewen and his wife were
scared by hearing Wooden-leg engaged in a furious
altercation with some one overhead.
</p>

<p>
"Dog, I'll blow out your brains!" yelled a strange
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Fire and smoke! blow out the candle first&mdash;ha,
ha, ha! ho, ho, ho!" cried Wooden-leg; then there
ensued the explosion of a pistol, a dreadful stamping
of feet, with the sound of several men swearing and
fighting.  To all this Ewen and his wife hearkened
in fear and perplexity; at last something fell heavily
on the floor, and then all became still, and not a
sound was heard but the night wind sighing down
the glen.
</p>

<p>
Betimes in the morning Ewen, weary and unslept,
left his bed and ascended to the door of this terrible
lodger and tapped gently.
</p>

<p>
"Come in; why the devil this fuss and ceremony,
eh, comrade?" cried a hoarse voice, and there was
old Wooden-leg, not lying dead on the floor as Ewen
expected, or perhaps hoped; but stumping about in his
shirt sleeves, pipe-claying his facings, and whistling
the "Point of War."
</p>

<p>
On being questioned about the most unearthly
"row" of last night, he only bade Ewen mind his
own affairs, or uttered a volley of oaths, some of
which were Spanish, and mixing a can of gunpowder
grog drained it at a draught.
</p>

<p>
He was very quarrelsome, dictatorial, and scandalously
irreligious; thus his military reminiscences
were of so ferocious and blood-thirsty a nature, that
they were sufficient to scare any quiet man out of his
seven senses.  But it was more particularly in
relating the butcheries, murders, and ravages of
Cumberland in the highlands, that he exulted, and there
was always a terrible air of probability in all he said.
On Ewen once asking of him if he had ever been
punished for the many irregularities and cruelties
he so freely acknowledged having committed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Punished?  Fire and smoke, comrade, I should
think so; I have been flogged till the bones of my
back stood through the quivering flesh; I have been
picquetted, tied neck and heels, or sent to ride the
wooden horse, and to endure other punishments which
are now abolished in the king's service.  An officer
once tied me neck and heels for eight and forty
hours&mdash;ay, damme, till I lost my senses; but he lost
his life soon after, a shot from the rear killed him;
you understand me, comrade; ha, ha, ha! ho, ho,
ho! a shot from the rear."
</p>

<p>
"You murdered him?" said Ewen, in a tone of horror.
</p>

<p>
"I did not say so," cried Wooden-leg with an
oath, as he dealt his landlord a thwack across the
shins with his stump; "but I'll tell you how it
happened.  I was on the Carthagena expedition in
'41, and served amid all the horrors of that
bombardment, which was rendered unsuccessful by the
quarrels of the general and admiral; then the yellow
fever broke out among the troops, who were crammed
on board the ships of war like figs in a cask, or like
the cargo of a slaver, so they died in scores&mdash;and
in scores their putrid corpses lay round the hawsers
of the shipping, which raked them up every day as
they swung round with the tide; and from all the
open gunports, where their hammocks were hung,
our sick men saw the ground sharks gorging
themselves on the dead, while they daily expected to
follow.  The air was black with flies, and the
scorching sun seemed to have leagued with the infernal
Spaniards against us.  But, fire and smoke, mix me
some more grog, I am forgetting my story!
</p>

<p>
"Our Grenadiers, with those of other regiments,
under Colonel James Grant of Carron, were landed
on the Island of Tierrabomba, which lies at the
entrance of the harbour of Carthagena, where we
stormed two small forts which our ships had
cannonaded on the previous day.
</p>

<p>
"Grenadiers&mdash;open your pouches&mdash;handle grenades&mdash;blow
your fuses!" cried Grant, "forward."
</p>

<p>
"And then we bayonetted the dons, or with the
clubbed musket smashed their heads like ripe
pumpkins, while our fleet, anchored with broadsides to
the shore, threw shot and shell, grape, cannister,
carcasses, and hand-grenades in showers among the
batteries, booms, cables, chains, ships of war,
gunboats, and the devil only knows what more.
</p>

<p>
"It was evening when we landed, and as the
ramparts of San Luiz de Bocca Chica were within
musket shot of our left flank, the lieutenant of our
company was left with twelve grenadiers (of whom I
was one) as a species of out-picquet to watch the
Spaniards there, and to acquaint the officer in the
captured forts if anything was essayed by way of sortie.
</p>

<p>
"About midnight I was posted as an advanced
sentinel, and ordered to face La Bocca Chica with
all my ears and eyes open.  The night was close and
sultry; there was not a breath of wind stirring on
the land or waveless sea; and all was still save the
cries of the wild animals that preyed upon the
unburied dead, or the sullen splash caused by some
half-shrouded corpse, as it was launched from a
gun-port, for our ships were moored within pistol-shot
of the place where I stood.
</p>

<p>
"Towards the west the sky was a deep and lurid
red, as if the midnight sea was in flames at the
horizon; and between me and this fiery glow, I could
see the black and opaque outline of the masts, the
yards, and the gigantic hulls of those floating
charnel-houses our line-of-battle ships, and the dark
solid ramparts of San Luiz de Bocca Chica.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly I saw before me the head of a Spanish
column!"
</p>

<p>
"I cocked my musket, they seemed to be halted
in close order, for I could see the white coats and
black hats of a single company only.  So I fired at
them point blank, and fell back on the picquet, which
stood to arms.
</p>

<p>
"The lieutenant of our grenadiers came hurrying
towards me.
</p>

<p>
"Where are the dons?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"In our front, sir," said I, pointing to the white
line which seemed to waver before us in the gloom
under the walls of San Luiz, and then it disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"They are advancing," said I.
</p>

<p>
"They have vanished, fellow," said the lieutenant,
angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Because they have marched down into a hollow."
</p>

<p>
"In a moment after they re-appeared, upon which
the lieutenant brought up the picquet, and after
firing three volleys retired towards the principal fort
where Colonel Grant had all the troops under arms;
but not a Spaniard approached us, and what, think
you, deceived me and caused this alarm?  Only a
grove of trees, fire and smoke! yes, it was a grove
of manchineel trees, which the Spaniards had cut
down or burned to within five feet of the ground;
and as their bark is white it resembled the Spanish
uniform, while the black burned tops easily passed
for their grenadier caps to the overstrained eyes of a
poor anxious lad, who found himself under the heavy
responsibility of an advanced sentinel for the first
time in his life."
</p>

<p>
"And was this the end of it?" asked Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"Hell and Tommy?" roared the Wooden-leg, "no&mdash;but
you shall hear.  I was batooned by the lieutenant;
then I was tried at the drumhead for causing
a false alarm, and sentenced to be tied neck and
heels, and lest you may not know the fashion of this
punishment I shall tell you of it.  I was placed on
the ground; my firelock was put under my hams,
and another was placed over my neck; then the two
were drawn close together by two cartouch-box
straps; and in this situation, doubled up as round
as a ball, I remained with my chin wedged between
my knees until the blood spouted out of my mouth,
nose, and ears, and I became insensible.  When I
recovered my senses the troops were forming in
column, preparatory to assaulting Fort San Lazare;
and though almost blind, and both weak and
trembling, I was forced to take my place in the ranks;
and I ground my teeth as I handled my musket and
saw the lieutenant of our company, in lace-ruffles
and powdered wig, prepare to join the forlorn hope,
which was composed of six hundred chosen grenadiers,
under Colonel Grant, a brave Scottish officer.
I loaded my piece with a charmed bullet, cast in a
mould given to me by an Indian warrior, and marched
on with my section.  The assault failed.  Of the
forlorn hope I alone escaped, for Grant and his
Grenadiers perished to a man in the breach.  There,
too, lay our lieutenant.  A shot had pierced his head
behind, just at the queue.  Queer, was it not? when
I was his covering file?"
</p>

<p>
As he said this, Wooden-leg gave Ewen another of
those diabolical leers, which always made his blood
ran cold, and continued,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I passed him as he lay dead, with his sword in
his hand, his fine ruffled shirt and silk waistcoat
drenched with blood&mdash;by the bye, there was a pretty
girl's miniature, with powdered hair peeping out of it
too.  'Ho, ho!' thought I, as I gave him a hearty
kick; 'you will never again have me tied neck-and-heels
for not wearing spectacles on sentry, or get me
a hundred lashes, for not having my queue dressed
straight to the seam of my coat."
</p>

<p>
"Horrible!" said Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"I will wager my wooden leg against your two of
flesh and bone, that your officer would have been
served in the same way, if he had given you the same
provocation."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!" said Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!  Ho, ho, ho!" cried Wooden-leg.
</p>

<p>
"You spoke of an Indian warrior," said Ewen,
uneasily, as the atrocious anecdotes of this hideous
old man excited his anger and repugnance; "then
you have served, like myself, in the New World?"
</p>

<p>
"Fire and smoke!  I should think so, but long
before your day."
</p>

<p>
"Then you fought against the Cherokees?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"At Warwomans Creek?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I was killed there."
</p>

<p>
"You were&mdash;what?" stammered Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"Killed there."
</p>

<p>
"Killed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, scalped by the Cherokees; dam! don't I
speak plain enough?"
</p>

<p>
"He is mad," thought Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"I am not mad," said Wooden-leg gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"I never said so," urged Ewen.
</p>

<p>
"Thunder and blazes! but you thought it, which
is all the same."
</p>

<p>
Ewen was petrified by this remark, and then
Wooden-leg, while fixing his hyæna-like eye upon
him, and mixing a fresh can of his peculiar grog,
continued thus,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I served in the Warwomans Creek expedition
in '60.  In the preceding year I had been taken
prisoner at Fort Ninety-six, and was carried off by
the Indians.  They took me into the heart of their
own country, where an old Sachem protected me,
and adopted me in place of a son he had lost in
battle.  Now this old devil of a Sachem had a
daughter&mdash;a graceful, pretty and gentle Indian girl, whom
her tribe named the Queen of the Beaver dams.  She
was kind to me, and loved to call me her pale-faced
brother.  Ha, ha, ha!  Ho, ho, ho!  Fire and
smoke! do I now look like a man that could once
attract a pretty girl's eye,&mdash;now, with my wooden-leg,
patched face and riddled carcase?  Well, she
loved me, and I pretended to be in love too, though
I did not care for her the value of an old snapper.
She was graceful and round in every limb, as a
beautiful statue.  Her features were almost regular&mdash;her
eyes black and soft; her hair hung nearly to her
knees, while her smooth glossy skin, was no darker
than a Spanish brunette's.  Her words were like
notes of music, for the language of the Cherokees,
like that of the Iroquois, is full of the softest vowels.
This Indian girl treated me with love and kindness,
and I promised to become a Cherokee warrior, a
thundering turtle and scalp-hunter for her sake&mdash;just
as I would have promised anything to any other
woman, and had done so a score of times before.
I studied her gentle character in all its weak and
delicate points, as a general views a fortress he is
about to besiege, and I soon knew every avenue to
the heart of the place.  I made my approaches with
modesty, for the mind of the Indian virgin was timid,
and as pure as the new fallen snow.  I drew my
parallels and pushed on the trenches whenever the
old Sachem was absent, smoking his pipe and
drinking fire-water at the council of the tribe; I soon
reached the base of the glacis and stormed the
breastworks&mdash;dam!  I did, comrade.
</p>

<p>
"I promised her everything, if she would continue
to love me, and swore by the Great Spirit to lay at
her feet the scalp-lock of the white chief, General the
Lord Amherst, K.C.B., and all that, with every other
protestation that occurred to me at the time; and so
she soon loved me&mdash;and me alone&mdash;as we wandered
on the green slopes of Tennessee, when the flowering
forest-trees and the magnolias, the crimson strawberries,
and the flaming azalea made the scenery beautiful;
and where the shrill cry cf the hawk, and the
carol of the merry mocking-bird, filled the air with
sounds of life and happiness.
</p>

<p>
"We were married in the fantastic fashion of the
tribe, and the Indian girl was the happiest squaw in
the Beaver dams.  I hoed cotton and planted rice;
I cut rushes that she might plait mats and baskets; I
helped her to weave wampum, and built her a
wigwam, but I longed to be gone, for in six months I
was wearied of her and the Cherokees too.  In short,
one night, I knocked the old Sachem on the head,
and without perceiving that he still breathed, pocketted
his valuables, such as they were, two necklaces of
amber beads and two of Spanish dollars, and without
informing my squaw of what I had done, I prevailed
upon her to guide me far into the forest, on the skirts
of which lay a British outpost, near the lower end of
the vale, through which flows the Tennessee River.
She was unable to accompany me more than a few
miles, for she was weak, weary, and soon to become a
mother; so I gave her the slip in the forest, and,
leaving her to shift for herself, reached head-quarters,
just as the celebrated expedition from South
Carolina was preparing to march against the Cherokees.
</p>

<p>
"Knowing well the localities, I offered myself as a
guide, and was at once accepted&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Cruel and infamous!" exclaimed honest Ewen,
whose chivalric Highland spirit fired with indignation
at these heartless avowals; "and the poor girl
you deceived&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  I thought the wild beasts would soon
dispose of her."
</p>

<p>
"But then the infamy of being a guide, even for
your comrades, against those who had fed and
fostered, loved and protected you!  By my soul, this
atrocity were worthy of King William and his Glencoe
assassins!"
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho, ho! fire and smoke! you shall hear.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we marched from New York in the early
part of 1760.  There were our regiment, with four
hundred of the Scots Royals, and Montgomery's
Highlanders.  We landed at Charleston, and marched
up the country to Fort Ninety-six on the frontier of
the Cherokees.  Our route was long and arduous, for
the ways were wild and rough, so it was the first of
June before we reached Twelve-mile River.  I had
been so long unaccustomed to carry my knapsack,
that its weight rendered me savage and ferocious, and
I cursed the service and my own existence; for in
addition to our muskets and accoutrements, our sixty
rounds of ball cartridge per man, we carried our own
tents, poles, pegs, and cooking utensils.  Thunder
and blazes! when we halted, which we did in a
pleasant valley, where the great shady chestnuts and the
flowering hickory made our camp alike cool and
beautiful, my back and shoulders were nearly skinned;
for as you must know well, comrade, the knapsack
straps are passed so tightly under the armpits, that
they stop the circulation of the blood, and press upon
the lungs almost to suffocation.  Scores of our men
left the ranks on the march, threw themselves down
in despair, and were soon tomahawked and scalped
by the Indians.
</p>

<p>
"We marched forward next day, but without perceiving
the smallest vestige of an Indian trail; thus
we began to surmise that the Cherokees knew not
that we were among them; but just as the sun was
sinking behind the blue hills, we came upon a cluster
of wigwams, which I knew well; they were the
Beaver dams, situated on a river, among wild woods
that never before had echoed to the drum or bugle.
</p>

<p>
"Bad and wicked as I was, some strange emotions
rose within me at this moment.  I thought of the
Sachem's daughter&mdash;her beauty&mdash;her love for me, and
the child that was under her bosom when I abandoned
her in the vast forest through which we had
just penetrated; but I stifled all regret, and heard
with pleasure the order to 'examine flints and
priming.'
</p>

<p>
"Then the Cherokee warwhoop pierced the echoing
sky; a scattered fire was poured upon us from
behind the rocks and trees; the sharp steel
tomahawks came flashing and whirling through the air;
bullets and arrows whistled, and rifles rung, and in a
moment we found ourselves surrounded by a living
sea of dark-skinned and yelling Cherokees, with
plumes on their scalp locks, their fierce visages
streaked with war paint, and all their moccasins
rattling.
</p>

<p>
"Fire and fury, such a time it was!
</p>

<p>
"We all fought like devils, but our men fell fast on
every side; the Royals lost two lieutenants, and several
soldiers whose scalps were torn from their bleeding
skulls in a moment.  Our regiment, though steady
under fire as a battalion of stone statues, now fell into
disorder, and the brown warriors, like fiends in aspect
and activity, pressed on with musket and war-club
brandished, and with such yells as never rang in mortal
ears elsewhere.  The day was lost, until the
Highlanders came up, and then the savages were routed
in an instant, and cut to pieces.  'Shoot and slash'
was the order; and there ensued such a scene of
carnage as I had not witnessed since Culloden, where
His Royal Highness, the fat Duke of Cumberland,
galloped about the field, overseeing the wholesale
butchery of the wounded.
</p>

<p>
"We destroyed their magazines of powder and
provisions; we laid the wigwams in ashes, and shot or
bayonetted every living thing, from the babe on its
mother's breast, to the hen that sat on the roost; for
as I had made our commander aware of all the avenues,
there was no escape for the poor devils of Cherokees.
Had the pious, glorious, and immortal King William
been there, he would have thought we had modelled
the whole affair after his own exploit at Glencoe.
</p>

<p>
"All was nearly over, and among the ashes of the
smoking wigwams and the gashed corpses of king's
soldiers and Indian warriors, I sat down beneath a
great chestnut to wipe my musket, for butt, barrel, and
bayonet were clotted with blood and human hair&mdash;ouf,
man, why do you shudder? it was only Cherokee
wool;&mdash;all was nearly over, I have said, when a low
fierce cry, like the hoarse hiss of a serpent, rang in
my ear; a brown and bony hand clutched my throat
as the fangs of a wolf would have done, and hurled
me to the earth!  A tomahawk flashed above me, and
an aged Indian's face, whose expression, was like
that of a fiend, came close to mine, and I felt his
breath upon my cheek.  It was the visage of the
sachem, but hollow with suffering and almost green
with fury, and he laughed like a hyæna, as he poised
the uplifted axe.
</p>

<p>
"Another form intervened for a moment; it
was that of the poor Indian girl I had so heartlessly
deceived; she sought to stay the avenging hand of
the frantic sachem; but he thrust her furiously
aside, and in the next moment the glittering
tomahawk was quivering in my brain&mdash;a knife swept
round my head&mdash;my scalp was torn off, and I
remember no more."
</p>

<p>
"A fortunate thing for you," said Ewen, drily;
"memory such as yours were worse than a
knapsack to carry; and so you were killed there?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't sneer, comrade," said Wooden-leg, with a
diabolical gleam in his eye: "prithee, don't sneet;
I was killed there, and, moreover, buried too, by the
Scots Royals, when they interred the dead next day."
</p>

<p>
"Then how came you to be here?" said Ewen,
not very much at ease, to find himself in company
with one he deemed a lunatic.
</p>

<p>
"Here? that is my business&mdash;not yours," was the
surly rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
Ewen was silent, but reckoned over that now
there were but thirty days to run until the 26th of
April, when the stipulated year would expire.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, comrade, just thirty days," said Wooden-leg,
with an affirmative nod, divining the thoughts of
Ewen; "and then I shall be off, bag and baggage,
if my friends come."
</p>

<p>
"If not?"
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall remain where I am."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord forbid!" thought Ewen; "but I can
apply to the sheriff."
</p>

<p>
"Death and fury!  Thunder and blazes!  I should
like to see the rascal of a sheriff who would dare to
meddle with me!" growled the old fellow, as his one
eye shot fire, and, limping away, he ascended the
stairs grumbling and swearing, leaving poor Ewen
terrified even to think, on finding that his thoughts,
although only half conceived, were at once divined
and responded to by this strange inmate of his
house.
</p>

<p>
"His friends," thought Ewen, "who may they be?"
</p>

<p>
Three heavy knocks rang on the floor overhead,
as a reply.
</p>

<p>
It was the wooden leg of the Cherokee invader.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><br />
THE PHANTOM REGIMENT&mdash;THE MIDNIGHT MARCH.
</h3>

<p>
This queer old fellow (continued the quartermaster)
was always in a state of great excitement,
and used an extra number of oaths, and mixed his
grog more thickly with gunpowder when a stray
red coat appeared far down the long green glen,
which was crossed by Ewen's lonely toll-bar.  Then
he would get into a prodigious fuss and bustle, and
was wont to pack and cord his trunk, to brush up
his well-worn and antique regimentals, and to
adjust his queue and the black cockade of his
triple-cornered hat, as if preparing to depart.
</p>

<p>
As the time of that person's wished-for departure
drew nigh, Ewen took courage, and shaking off the
timidity with which the swearing and boisterous
fury of Wooden-leg had impressed him, he ventured
to expostulate a little on the folly and sin of his
unmeaning oaths, and the atrocity of the crimes he
boasted of having committed.
</p>

<p>
But the wicked old Wooden-leg laughed and swore
more than ever, saying that a "true soldier was
never a religious one."
</p>

<p>
"You are wrong, comrade," retorted the old
Cameronian, taking fire at such an assertion;
"religion is the lightest burden a poor soldier can
carry; and, moreover, it hath upheld me on many a
long day's march, when almost sinking under hunger
and fatigue, with my pack, kettle, and sixty rounds
of ball ammunition on my back.  The duties of a
good and brave soldier are no way incompatible with
those of a Christian man; and I never lay down to
rest on the wet bivouac or bloody field, with my
knapsack, or it might be a dead comrade, for a
pillow, without thanking God&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;The God of Scotland's covenanted Kirk for
the mercies he vouchsafed to Ewen Mac Ewen, a
poor grenadier of the 26th Regiment."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho, ho!"
</p>

<p>
The old Cameronian took off his bonnet and lifted
up his eyes, as he spoke fervently, and with the
simple reverence of the olden time; but Wooden-leg
grinned and chuckled and gnashed his teeth as Ewen
resumed.
</p>

<p>
"A brave soldier may rush to the cannon's mouth,
though it be loaded with grape and cannister; or at
a line of levelled bayonets&mdash;and rush fearlessly
too&mdash;and yet he may tremble, without shame, at the thought
of hell, or of offended Heaven.  Is it not so,
comrade?  I shall never forget the words of our chaplain
before we stormed the Isles of Saba and St. Martin
from the Dutch, with Admiral Rodney, in '81."
</p>

<p>
"Bah&mdash;that was after I was killed by the Cherokees.  Well?"
</p>

<p>
"The Cameronians were formed in line, mid leg
in the salt water, with bayonets fixed, the colours
flying, the pipes playing and drums beating 'Britons
strike home,' and our chaplain, a reverend minister
of God's word, stood beside the colonel with the
shot and shell from the Dutch batteries flying about
his old white head, but he was cool and calm, for he
was the grandson of Richard Cameron, the glorious
martyr of Airdsmoss.
</p>

<p>
"'Fear not, my bairns,' cried he (he aye called us
his bairns, having ministered unto us for fifty years
and more)&mdash;'fear not; but remember that the eyes
of the Lord are on every righteous soldier, and that
His hand will shield him in the day of battle!'
</p>

<p>
"'Forward, my lads,' cried the colonel, waving his
broad sword, while the musket shot shaved the curls
of his old brigadier wig; 'forward, and at them with
your bayonets;' and bravely we fell on&mdash;eight
hundred Scotsmen, shoulder to shoulder&mdash;and in half
an hour the British flag was waving over the
Dutchman's Jack on the ramparts of St. Martin."
</p>

<p>
But to all Ewen's exordiums, the Wooden-leg replied
by oaths, or mockery, or his incessant laugh,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha!  Ho, ho, ho!"
</p>

<p>
At last came the long-wished for twenty-sixth of
April!
</p>

<p>
The day was dark and louring.  The pine woods
looked black, and the slopes of the distant hills
seemed close and near, and yet gloomy withal.  The
sky was veiled by masses of hurrying clouds, which
seemed to chase each other across the Moray Firth.
That estuary was flecked with foam, and the ships
were riding close under the lee of the Highland
shore, with topmasts struck, their boats secured, and
both anchors out, for everything betokened a coming
storm.
</p>

<p>
And with night it came in all its fury;&mdash;a storm
similar to that of the preceding year.
</p>

<p>
The fierce and howling wind swept through the
mountain gorges, and levelled the lonely shielings,
whirling their fragile roofs into the air, and
uprooting strong pines and sturdy beeches; the water was
swept up from the Loch of the Clans, and mingled
with the rain which drenched the woods around it.
The green and yellow lightning played in ghastly
gleams about the black summit of Dun Daviot, and
again the rolling thunder bellowed over the graves of
the dead on the bleak, dark moor of Culloden.
Attracted by the light in the windows of the toll house,
the red deer came down from the hills in herds and
cowered near the little dwelling; while the cries of
the affrighted partridges, blackcocks, and even those
of the gannets from the Moray Firth were heard at
times, as they were swept past, with branches, leaves,
and stones, on the skirts of the hurrying blast.
</p>

<p>
"It is just such a storm as we had this night
twelvemonths ago," said Meinie, whose cheek grew
pale at the elemental uproar.
</p>

<p>
"There will be no one coming up the glen to-night,"
replied Ewen; "so I may as well secure the
toll-bar, lest a gust should dash it to pieces."
</p>

<p>
It required no little skill or strength to achieve
this in such a tempest; the gate was strong and
heavy, but it was fastened at last, and Ewen
retreated to his own fireside.  Meanwhile, during all
this frightful storm without, Wooden-leg was heard
singing and carolling up-stairs, stumping about in
the lulls of the tempest, and rolling, pushing, and
tumbling his chest from side to side; then he
descended to get a fresh can of grog&mdash;for "grog,
grog, grog," was ever his cry.  His old withered face
was flushed, and his excited eye shone like a baleful
star.  He was conscious that a great event would
ensue.
</p>

<p>
Ewen felt happy in his soul that his humble home
should no longer be the resting-place of this evil
bird whom the last tempest had blown hither.
</p>

<p>
"So you leave us to-morrow, comrade?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"I'll march before daybreak," growled the other;
"'twas our old fashion in the days of Minden.  Huske
and Hawley always marched off in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Before daybreak?"
</p>

<p>
"Fire and smoke, I have said so, and you shall
see; for my friends are on the march already; but
good night, for I shall have to parade betimes.  They
come; though far, far off as yet."
</p>

<p>
He retired with one of his diabolical leers, and
Ewen and his wife ensconced themselves in the
recesses of their warm box-bed; Meinie soon fell into
a sound sleep, though the wind continued to howl,
the rain to lash against the trembling walls of the
little mansion, and the thunder to hurl peal after peal
across the sky of that dark and tempestuous night.
</p>

<p>
The din of the elements and his own thoughts
kept Ewen long awake; but though the gleams of
electric light came frequent as ever through the little
window, the glow of the "gathering peat" sank lower
on the hearth of hard-beaten clay, and the dull
measured tick-tack of the drowsy clock as it fell on the
drum of his ear, about midnight, was sending him to
sleep, by the weariness of its intense monotony, when
from a dream that the fierce hawk eye of his malevolent
lodger was fixed upon him, he started suddenly
to full consciousness.  An uproar of tongues now rose
and fell upon the gusts of wind without; and he
heard an authoritative voice requiring the toll-bar to
be opened.
</p>

<p>
Overhead rang the stumping of the Wooden-lag,
whose hoarse voice was heard bellowing in reply from
the upper window.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord have a care of us!" muttered Mac
Ewen, as he threw his kilt and plaid round him,
thrust on his bonnet and brogues, and hastened to
the door, which was almost blown in by the tempest
as he opened it.
</p>

<p>
The night was as dark, and the hurricane as
furious as ever; but how great was Ewen's surprise
to see the advanced guard of a corps of Grenadiers,
halted at the toll-bar gate, which he hastened to
unlock, and the moment he did so, it was torn off
its iron hooks and swept up the glen like a leaf from
a book, or a lady's handkerchief; as with an unearthly
howling the wind came tearing along in fitful
and tremendous gusts, which made the strongest
forests stoop, and dashed the struggling coasters on
the rocks of the Firth&mdash;the Æstuarium Vararis of
the olden time.
</p>

<p>
As the levin brands burst in lurid fury overhead,
they seemed to strike fire from the drenched rocks,
the dripping trees, and the long line of flooded
roadway, that wound through the pastoral glen towards
Culloden.
</p>

<p>
The advanced guard marched on in silence with
arms slung; and Ewen, to prevent himself from
being swept away by the wind, clung with both
hands to a stone pillar of the bar-gate, that he might
behold the passage of this midnight regiment, which
approached in firm and silent order in sections of
twelve files abreast, all with muskets slung.  The
pioneers were in front, with their leather aprons,
axes, saws, bill-hooks, and hammers; the band was
at the head of the column; the drums, fifes, and
colours were in the centre; the captains were at the
head of their companies; the subalterns on the
reverse flank, and the field-officers were all mounted
on black chargers, that curvetted and pranced like
shadows, without a sound.
</p>

<p>
Slowly they marched, but erect and upright, not a
man of them seeming to stoop against the wind or
rain, while overhead the flashes of the broad and
blinding lightning were blazing like a ghastly torch,
and making every musket-barrel, every belt-plate,
sword-blade, and buckle, gleam as this mysterious
corps filed through the barrier, with who?
Wooden-leg among them!
</p>

<p>
By the incessant gleams Ewen could perceive
that they were Grenadiers, and wore the quaint old
uniform of George II.'s time; the sugar-loaf-shaped
cap of red cloth embroidered with worsted; the great
square-tailed red coat with its heavy cuffs and
close-cut collar; the stockings rolled above the knee,
and enormous shoe-buckles.  They carried grenade-pouches;
the officers had espontoons; the sergeants
shouldered heavy halberds, and the coats of the little
drum-boys were covered with fantastic lace.
</p>

<p>
It was not the quaint and antique aspect of this
solemn battalion that terrified Ewen, or chilled his
heart; but the ghastly expression of their faces,
which were pale and hollow-eyed, being, to all
appearance, the visages of spectres; and they marched
past like a long and wavering panorama, without a
sound; for though the wind was loud, and the rain
was drenching, neither could have concealed the
measured tread of so many mortal feet; but there
was no footfall heard on the roadway, nor the tramp
of a charger's hoof; the regiment defiled past,
noiseless as a wreath of smoke.
</p>

<p>
The pallor of their faces, and the stillness which
accompanied their march, were out of the course of
nature; and the soul of Mac Ewen died away within
him; but his eyes were riveted upon the marching
phantoms&mdash;if phantoms, indeed, they were&mdash;as if by
fascination; and, like one in a terrible dream, he
continued to gaze until the last files were past; and
with them rode a fat and full-faced officer, wearing a
three-cocked hat, and having a star and blue ribbon
on his breast.  His face was ghastly like the rest,
and dreadfully distorted, as if by mental agony and
remorse.  Two aides-de-camps accompanied him, and
he rode a wild-looking black horse, whose eyes shot
fire.  At the neck of the fat spectre&mdash;for a spectre he
really seemed&mdash;hung a card.
</p>

<p>
It was the Nine of Diamonds!
</p>

<p>
The whole of this silent and mysterious battalion
passed in line of march up the glen, with the gleams of
lightning flashing about them.  One bolt more brilliant
than the rest brought back the sudden flash of steel.
</p>

<p>
They had fixed bayonets, and shouldered arms!
</p>

<p>
And on, and on they marched, diminishing in
the darkness and the distance, those ghastly Grenadiers,
towards the flat bleak moor of Culloden, with
the green lightning playing about them, and
gleaming on the storm-swept waste.
</p>

<p>
The Wooden-leg&mdash;Ewen's unco' guest&mdash;disappeared
with them, and was never heard of more in
Strathnairn.
</p>

<p>
He had come with a tempest, and gone with one.
Neither was any trace ever seen or heard of those
strange and silent soldiers.  No regiment had left
Nairn that night, and no regiment reached Inverness
in the morning; so unto this day the whole affair
remains a mystery, and a subject for ridicule with
some, although Ewen, whose story of the midnight
march of a corps in time of war&mdash;caused his examination
by the authorities in the Castle of Inverness&mdash;stuck
manfully to his assertions, which were further
corroborated by the evidence of his wife and children.
He made a solemn affidavit of the circumstances I
have related before the sheriff, whose court books
will be found to confirm them in every particular;
if not, it is the aforesaid sheriff's fault, and not mine.
</p>

<p>
There were not a few (but these were generally old
Jacobite ladies of decayed Highland families, who
form the gossiping tabbies and wall-flowers of the
Northern Meeting) who asserted that in their young
days they had heard of such a regiment marching by
night, once a year to the field of Culloden; for it is
currently believed by the most learned on such subjects
in the vicinity of the "Clach na Cudden," that on
the anniversary of the sorrowful battle, a certain place,
which shall be nameless, opens, and that the restless
souls of the murderers of the wounded clansmen
march in military array to the green graves upon the
purple heath, in yearly penance; and this story was
thought to receive full corroboration by the apparition
of a fat lubberly spectre with the nine of diamonds
chained to his neck; as it was on that card&mdash;since
named the Curse of Scotland&mdash;the Duke of Cumberland
hastily pencilled the savage order to "show no
quarter to the wounded, but to slaughter all."
</p>

<p>
Such was the story of our old Highland Quartermaster.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><br />
THE LAST OF DON FABRIQUE.
</h3>

<p>
A week or two after our return from Seville to
Gibraltar, Jack Slingsby received a note from a
Spanish officer, who commanded a detachment of the
Grenadiers of Jaen, to the effect that the famous
bandit Fabrique de Urquija had been taken, and was
condemned to die by the spirited Alcalde of San
Roque; that his execution was to take place on the
day after to-morrow, and that if we wished to behold
the mode of punishing such criminals in Spain, it
would afford him much pleasure if we joined his party,
which was ordered to assist in guarding the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
Though neither of us were animated by a love of
cruelty or taste for the morbid, we were somewhat
curious to see how this romantic vagabond, who so
pitilessly had meted out death to so many others,
would encounter his own terrible doom, and availing
ourselves of the Spanish officer's polite offer, we
procured a day's leave, rode over to breakfast with him,
and marched with his detachment to San Roque, a
little town, which lies, as I have elsewhere said, about
six miles from our garrison on the Spanish side.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded, the Spanish capitano told us the
little episode of Don Fabrique's capture.
</p>

<p>
It happened thus.
</p>

<p>
The Alcalde of San Roque was reputed to be
immensely wealthy, and to have in a secret place a
strong box full of yellow doubloons and rich silver
duros, piled up in shining pillars to its brim, like the
treasure chests which the Moors are supposed to have
hidden in all the old castles and ruined atalayas in
Spain, and all of which are occasionally visible to
those who have the fortune of being born on Good
Friday, as every Spaniard knows.
</p>

<p>
The rumour of this wealth could not fail to reach
the ears of Don Fabrique, and to excite the cupidity
of that enterprising gentleman; but concealing his
intentions from his band, whom he intended to leave,
as he proposed to himself a little trip to Paris or
Peru, if he relieved the Alcalde of those cares which
are inseparable from the possession of wealth, he
reconnoitred the house, and found an entrance to a
room wherein he secreted himself beneath a bed,
which stood in an alcove off it.  In this bed the
portly alcalde and his buxom wife were wont to take
their repose; so Don Fabrique had not been very long
in this place of concealment, when the lady came in
with a lamp in her hand, and placing it on the toilet
table, proceeded to divest her charming person of her
habiliments.
</p>

<p>
She threw the fag end of her cigar into the brassero;
hung her wig upon a knob of the mirror, et cetera.
She then dipped a finger into the little font of holy
water which hung at the head of her bed, and stepped
in, to await the coming of her worthy spouse, who
was lingering over the 'Heraldo' and a glass of
Valdepenas in the dining-room below.
</p>

<p>
Now as the bed had a canvas bottom like a
hammock, and the lady therein was equal in size and
weight to three ordinary women, Don Fabrique, with
natural consternation, reflected on what he should
have to endure, when the gorbellied alcalde was added
to the superincumbent load of the señora.
</p>

<p>
"Demonio!" thought he, "what is to be done?  I
shall be suffocated before that brute the señor patron
is half asleep!"
</p>

<p>
The panting robber stirred uneasily, and the stout
lady above him started.
</p>

<p>
"Madre de Dios, what is that!" she whispered to
herself.
</p>

<p>
There was no response; but on Fabrique stirring
again, the señora fairly sprang in terror from her
bed.  Fabrique dared not breathe, but with one hand
on his stiletto and the other on his lips, he lay still
as death.  The lady now obtained a glimpse of his foot.
and uttering one of those shrill cries, which most
women can utter at any time, she rushed from the
chamber to seek her husband; but first she took the
precaution of double-locking the door.
</p>

<p>
Finding himself discovered, and aware that all was
over now, Fabrique hastened to escape by his place of
entrance, the window.  Alas! it was now secured by
a shutter crossed by iron bars on the outside, and
these resisted all his efforts.  There was no chimney;
again he rushed to the door.  It was firm&mdash;fast
as a rock, and he might as well have rushed against
the stone wall.  He heard the clank of feet and of
halberts as the hastily-summoned alguazils came into
the room below; true, he had his dagger; but what
would that avail him against so many?  The perspiration
burst over his brow and he cursed the avarice
which brought him on such errand unassisted by that
faithful and determined band he was about to leave
for ever.
</p>

<p>
Fertile in expedients, he at last thought of one.
</p>

<p>
He threw off all his clothes and popped into the
bed of the señor alcalde, and scarcely had he tucked
himself cosily in when the door was burst open, and
in marched the portly patron, his eyes dilated with
vengeance, and his paunch swollen with official
dignity and purple valdepenas, while the grim alguazils
with pointed halberts and cocked trabujas came
behind, and with them was the terrified lady in her
night-dress, holding a candle in one trembling hand,
her rosary and a case of reliques in the other.
</p>

<p>
Fabrique gazed at them with well-feigned surprise,
which was reflected in the faces of all on beholding
the place of his retreat, though it soon turned to
resentment in the wife of the alcalde; her eyes
flashed; her plump cheeks and bosom became
crimson with anger.
</p>

<p>
"How now, señor raterillo," thundered the alcalde;
"what am I to understand by all this?"
</p>

<p>
"By what, most worthy señor," whined the robber,
with affected simplicity and shame.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;your being here&mdash;here, señor&mdash;in the bed
of the señora&mdash;in my bed?" continued the alcalde,
gathering courage from the loudness of his own
voice; "speak, rascal&mdash;why are you here?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask the señora, who invited me," replied Fabrique.
with the coolest assurance in the world.
</p>

<p>
"Morte de Dios, what is this I hear?" muttered
the overwhelmed alcalde.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ask her, for I did not come here unexpected,
believe me, most worthy and much-injured Señor
Patron," continued the cunning rogue as he leaped
out of bed, and assisted by the tittering alguazils,
put on his garments with all haste, while the wife of
the poor alcalde gazed upon him speechless with rage
at the inference and his accusation, while the
magistrate himself was baffled and blanched by a new and
vague sense of shame and consternation.
</p>

<p>
"My dear señora," said Fabrique, in a bland tone,
as he tied on his sash and assumed his sombrero,
"I regret extremely that you are weary of me&mdash;that
my company is no longer pleasing to you, as of old;
but it is very cruel of you to bring the neck of a poor
lover so faithful as I into such deadly jeopardy, and I
shall treasure this lesson of female perfidy, revenge,
and caprice to my latest hour.  Muchas gracias,
señora, much good may your trick do you."
</p>

<p>
The lady was choking with anger and unmerited
shame, while the cunning rogue continued,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Most worthy Señor Alcalde, most faithless and
fickle señora, and you, most paltry and pitiful señores
alguazils, I have the honour to wish you all a very
good evening."
</p>

<p>
With a low bow and a mocking smile, he was about
to depart, when one of the alguazils exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stop&mdash;seize him; by Santiago, 'tis Fabrique de
Urquija!"
</p>

<p>
The face of the robber became black with fury; he
drew his stiletto and rushed upon his discoverer, but
was soon beaten down by the halberts and clubbed
blunderbusses of the officials, by whom he was bound
with cords and dragged to prison without delay.
</p>

<p>
He was soon tried in due form, and though the
whole town rang with his terrible exploits, and the
women praised his handsome figure, his reckless
courage, and the great tact and skill by which he had
so nearly eluded the pot-bellied Alcalde, he was
sentenced "to be garotted at twelve o'clock to-day."
</p>

<p>
Such was the detail given to us by the Spanish
officer.
</p>

<p>
As we neared San Roque, we found great crowds
from remote parts of the judicial partido, all clad in
the picturesque and antique costumes of the province,
ascending the mountain on which the town is situated,
and all anxious to behold the dying demeanour of the
most famous of Spanish bandits&mdash;the greatest since
Manuel Francisco was shot at Cordova two years ago.
</p>

<p>
The mountain of San Roque stands at the head of
a beautiful bay of the same name; and on looking
back as we ascended, we had a charming view of the
sea, with several large Xebecques floating like gigantic
white birds with wings outspread upon its shining
azure surface.
</p>

<p>
A clear and brilliant morning sun poured a flood
of light athwart the picturesque plaza of San Roque,
into which, as one may easily imagine, the whole male
population of the town&mdash;about eight thousand&mdash;were
crowded.  This plaza resembled a sea of human heads
covered with black or brown sombreros; though there
were many who wore only their own coarse black hair
in netted cauls, and a few had scarlet forage caps.
Above this crowd glittered the bayonets and the
glazed shakoes of a battalion of Infantry of the
Spanish line, from the adjacent barracks.  These
surrounded the high wooden platform of the garotte.
Within their line were the poor old ecclesiastics of
the two suppressed convents and three hospitals of
San Roque, wearing the remarkable monastic
costumes of a past age.
</p>

<p>
The principal place was occupied by the commandant
of the fortified camp of San Roque, who, upon
our appearing among the crowd in our British uniform,
sent his aide-de-camp, with a polite invitation for us
to join his staff, which we immediately accepted.
</p>

<p>
On the centre of the platform, which was about
twenty feet square, and covered with black cloth, sat
the fallen Fabrique de Urquija upon a little wooden
stool, with his back placed against the upright post
of the garotte, the iron collar of which encircled his
brawny naked neck.  His broad low brow was black
as a thunder cloud; his eyes were fierce and keen,
and with a lowering glance of scornful pride, he
surveyed the masses who crowded on every inch of space
that afforded footing.  His ancles were chained to an
eyebolt on the floor of the platform.  Near him stood
the old confessor José de Torquemada of Medina,
barefooted; his cowl thrown back; in his wrinkled
hands an ivory crucifix, which ever and anon he
placed to the quivering lips of the doomed man in
the interval of prayer.
</p>

<p>
Poor Urquija!  I forgot all his atrocities and the
evil he would once have done to Slingsby and myself;
and now I felt only pity for his terrible situation.
</p>

<p>
"I saw your glance of commiseration," said Jack
quietly, as he prepared a cigarito; "but be assured,
Ramble, you may as well feel pity for a bruised wolf.
I have not forgotten the Rio de Muerte, and that
night on the hills above Trohniona."
</p>

<p>
"Noble Caballeros&mdash;buenos Christianos," said a
venerable Franciscan, placing before us the wooden
platter on which he was receiving the reals and pence
of the faithful; "por neustra Señora Santissima, one
little medio for the sinful soul of Fabrique de
Urquija."
</p>

<p>
Jack and I&mdash;though believing but little in monk
or mass&mdash;were taught as soldiers to respect the
religious prejudices of all men; thus we were touched
by the honest piety of these old pillars of a dying
creed&mdash;-dying at least in Spain; and we each threw in
a gold coin.  This raised an approving murmur
among the people, and the prisoner gave us a glance
full of recognition and gratitude.  We had paid
enough for fifty masses!
</p>

<p>
The church bell now began to toll a passing knell.
</p>

<p>
Then the alguazils, who wore the cavalier costume
of other times&mdash;the broad hat, the long locks, the
white vandyke collar over a little shoulder mantle,
the short knee-breeches and buckled shoes, of the
days of Cervantes, advanced their halberts and
ascended the scaffold, accompanied by the executioner,
who was dressed in the deepest black.  All
present now murmured and looked round, and several
officers drew their swords, for rumours of a projected
rescue were current in San Roque and its vicinity.
</p>

<p>
The confession was ended, and if all the horrors
which rumour ascribed to the unhappy Urquija were
true, what a revelation it must have been!  What a
volume it would have made!
</p>

<p>
José Torquemada remained on his knees beside the
penitent, who turned to him ever and anon, anxiously
and hurriedly to pour into his ear some newly-remembered
act of guilt, or perhaps to spin out the
thread of life a little&mdash;a very little longer.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the solemn bell continued tolling; the
people around the scaffold were nearly all upon their
knees, and the grasp of the executioner was laid upon
the iron wrench or screw of the garotte.  The face
of the culprit flushed as he did so, and then grew
pale as marble.
</p>

<p>
The hand of the church clock indicated the hour
of noon; then a cannon pealed from the fortifications
of San Roque and the priest pointed with his
crucifix to Heaven, while the executioner, at that
instant, gave the screw a vigorous twist, and the head
of Urquija fell suddenly on his breast.  It heaved a
little, and all was over.
</p>

<p>
A "viva" mingled with the prayers of the people;
but the dead man remained motionless and still,
under that bright sunshine of noon; and then rose
the hum of many voices as if a load had been taken
off every breast; while the bayonets flashed and the
sharp brass drums beat merrily, as the Spanish
Infantry wheeled from hollow square into open
column of companies, and marched by sections through
the Plaza to the fortified camp of San Roque; then
the crowd, who, up to the last moment had foretold
and expected a rescue from the band of Urquija, who
were hovering and vowing vengeance on the Sierra
de Ronda, began to disperse.
</p>

<p>
Such was the last act in the terrible career of
Fabrique de Urquija, the student of Alcala; and such was
the last episode of Jack Slingsby's Spanish
adventures and mine.
</p>

<p>
We dined with the Commandant at the fortified
camp of San Roque, and in the evening rode back to
Gibraltar, where we found the garrison in a buzz of
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I asked of a sentinel at
the lower fortifications as we rode in; "and for what
reason was that heavy cannon fired after sunset?"
</p>

<p>
"The Himalaya has come in, sir, with Sir Henry
Slingsby and a detachment of the Guards on board;
she is at anchor in the roads, and your regiment is
ordered to embark for the Crimea by gunfire to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cried Jack, and we dashed at full speed
to our barracks, where the clusters of our soldiers in
the square, laughing and talking gaily, the colonel's
orderly running after the adjutant, the adjutant calling
for the Serjeant major, and the evident excitement
and satisfaction visible in every face, corroborated
the information of the sentinel, and impressed upon
us the necessity of immediately packing our
baggage; but before doing so, I dispatched at once to
press these little tales and episodes which have
lightened and beguiled our mess-table in old
Gibraltar; and if they please my readers, and win from
them but half the praise they won from my light
hearted and brave brother officers, my task in
collecting them will be more than recompensed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
